sm15_00117	The man hid in a back alley to observe the Scarab People...	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm15_00118	That must mean he's trying to stay out of sight.	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm15_00120	I need to head down to the lower levels.	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm15_00150k_010	According to the \n synopsis, the author \n should be hiding in a \n back street somewhere.	[0, 82, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
