ep22_00124	Attendant: \n How could I miss it? Never seen one like it.	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00125	Attendant: \n King Cai's guardian certainly proves he's royalty.	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00126	Attendant: \n Yeah, so different from the old queen.	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00127	Attendant: \n I saw a painting of the old queen once.	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00128	Attendant: \n And she hasn't aged a day... Creepy if you ask me.	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00129	Attendant: \n 100 years later and not a day older, is that even possible?	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 70, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00130	Attendant: \n Maybe she's an imposter?	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00131	Attendant: \n I wish that prisoner would stay quiet.	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00132	Attendant: \n No kidding, you know, she tried to bite me!	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00133	Attendant: \n We barely got her in her cage.	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

ep22_00143	Attendant: \n Sounded like it was about the old queen.	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00144	Attendant: \n Hmm, wonder what it was about?	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00145	Guard: \n Open the doors!	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [7, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00146	I need to write what happened today in my diary.	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00147	Hmm, none of these books look very interesting...	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00148	Attendant: \n ...	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 14, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00149	Cai: \n Good luck with your royal audience today, Auntie.	[0, 5, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [5, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00150	Attendant: \n Queen Alua, should you be back here?	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00151	Attendant: \n My shift's done.	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 27, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00152	Attendant: \n Anything to report?	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

ep22_00154	Attendant: \n Stubborn. Some people don't know when to give up.	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00155	Xicero: \n Queen Alua, were you heading to the cathedral?	[0, 8, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [8, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

ep22_00157	Attendant: \n She didn't get much sleep with the dreams.	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00158	Xicero: \n That's not unusual given her environment has changed.	[0, 8, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [8, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00159	Attendant: \n I'll do my best to keep her comfortable.	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00160	Attendant: \n Good morning, Queen Alua.	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

ep22_00163	Attendant: \n There's nothing in that room that would interest you.	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 64, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00164	Attendant: \n Have a good audience.	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00165	Attendant: \n You look pale, you should get some rest.	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [11, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00166	It's getting late... Maybe I should go to bed.	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00200m_010	I am Alua, the queen who \n vanished a hundred years ago...	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00200m_020	My unexpected return has left \n everyone very confused.	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00200m_030	...ua... Queen Alua?	[0, 20, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00210k_010	Huh? \n What happened \n to the music?	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00210k_020	You're awake, \n Queen Alua.	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00210k_030	Did you hear a music box \n playing just now?	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00210k_040	A music box? No, perhaps \n my queen was dreaming?	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00210k_050	Yeah... Must have been.	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00210k_060	I apologize for bringing \n this up so soon after \n waking...	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00210k_070	But it's time for the \n royal audience. Your \n subjects are waiting to \n see you.	[0, 75, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00210k_080	I just need to hear what \n they have to say, right?	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00210k_090	Of course. Please head \n to the cathedral at your \n earliest convenience.	[0, 69, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00210k_100	I'll go there shortly.	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00210k_110	Another royal audience. \n More excitement \n awaits...	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00211k_010	Queen Alua, how are you \n feeling?	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00211k_020	Fine, thank you for \n asking. You're-	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00211k_030	Xicero, the Senate \n Chancellor.	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00211k_040	Xicero... Xicero... I'm \n sorry, I'm having \n trouble remembering.	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00211k_050	Please don't worry \n yourself, my queen.	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00211k_060	Your illness must have \n taken a toll on you. \n Your memories need time \n to recover.	[0, 79, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00211k_070	Illness... Of course.	[0, 21, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00211k_080	...	[0, 3, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00211k_090	Is something the matter?	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00211k_100	No, not at all. If \n anything, I'm gladdened \n to see you up and about \n in such good health.	[0, 87, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00211k_110	My apologies for \n interrupting you. Your \n audience awaits.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00211k_120	Of course, I should \n hurry.	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00211k_130	Maybe all of those \n strange dreams I was \n having are from the \n illness...	[0, 70, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00212k_010	Queen Alua, are you \n feeling well?	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00212k_020	A century away and then \n a sudden return...	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00212k_030	It's quite natural you \n wouldn't be feeling \n your best.	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00212k_040	I have to admit, things \n are a little fuzzy, but \n I'm feeling fine.	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00212k_050	Oh, that's good to hear.	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00212k_060	It was a pleasure to see \n you today, my queen.	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00212k_070	Wonder who \n that guy was?	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00213k_010	Queen Alua, I brought \n one of the more popular \n stories of Eto for your \n amusement.	[0, 80, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00213k_020	I can only imagine how \n dull things must be \n while you recover...	[0, 63, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00213k_030	I hope it provides some \n amusement.	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00213k_040	A book, for me? I'd be \n happy to read it.	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00213k_050	Though I'd rather \n be let outside than \n forced to stay in \n reading books...	[0, 72, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00214k_010	Queen Alua, how \n wonderful it is to see \n you.	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00214k_020	I've met this guy \n before, haven't I? \n It's so hard to \n remember faces...	[0, 70, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00214k_030	You haven't changed a \n bit from when we saw you \n last, over 100 years \n ago.	[0, 72, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00214k_040	You knew me 100 years \n ago? How?	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00214k_050	I was just a young boy \n then, of course, you \n used to let me up onto \n your knee.	[0, 77, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00214k_060	And you still look \n exactly the same now as \n you did then.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00214k_070	The people of Eto live a \n long time, but I've \n never heard of anything \n like this.	[0, 79, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00214k_080	Perhaps the royal family \n ages better than the \n rest of us.	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00214k_090	What was I like \n 100 years ago? \n I can't even remember...	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00215k_010	Queen Alua, your royal \n audience has ended.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00215k_020	You must be exhausted. \n Please, return to your \n room and rest.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00215k_030	I am and I will. \n Thank you.	[0, 27, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00216k_010	Queen Alua, how are you \n feeling today?	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00216k_020	If you feel off, \n you should-	[0, 28, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00216k_030	No, I'm fine, as you can \n see. But thank you for \n asking.	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00216k_040	Then that's a relief.	[0, 21, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00216k_050	It makes me glad to see \n you up and about.	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00216k_060	All these people asking \n after my health, it's \n going to make me sick if \n I wasn't already.	[0, 88, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00217k_010	Queen Alua, you're just \n as beautiful as you were \n 100 years ago.	[0, 63, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00217k_020	This again?	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00217k_030	I've grown so old in \n your absence, it's \n almost like you could be \n my granddaughter.	[0, 82, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00217k_040	...	[0, 3, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00217k_050	The royal family must be \n protected by quite an \n amazing power.	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00217k_060	It sure doesn't feel \n like there's anything \n special about me...	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00220k_010	Good morning, \n Queen Alua.	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00220k_020	Yeah...	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00220k_030	There is quite a crowd \n of people waiting for an \n audience with you.	[0, 66, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_010	Don't go overworking \n her, now.	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_020	She needs time to \n recover, after losing \n her memory from that \n illness...	[0, 71, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_030	...	[0, 3, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_040	Good morning, \n Auntie!	[0, 21, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_050	Auntie? \n Who are \n you again?	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_060	It's me, Cai.	[0, 13, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_070	Don't tell me you've \n forgotten me already.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_080	Cai... \n Am I really \n your aunt?	[0, 29, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_090	Well, technically I \n inherited the throne \n from the person who \n inherited after you...	[0, 83, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_100	That makes me \n the king of Eto.	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_110	We're not related by \n blood or anything, \n but it feels like \n we're family.	[0, 71, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_120	That's why I think of \n you like an aunt.	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_130	You are the famous queen \n who disappeared a \n hundred years ago, \n right?	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_140	I'd love to talk, but \n you've got a busy day \n ahead of you.	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_150	Good luck, but promise \n me you'll take it easy, \n okay?	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_160	It's just sitting around \n listening to people \n speak...	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_170	Of course. Of course. \n Anyway, we'll talk \n later.	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_180	I'm not totally against \n the "Auntie" thing...	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_190	He's a cute enough kid.	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00221k_200	Just wish maybe he \n would've picked \n something that didn't \n make me feel so old.	[0, 77, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00222k_010	Queen Alua, has anything \n happened since we last \n met?	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00222k_020	Say, for example, your \n guardian showing up?	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00222k_030	My guardian?	[0, 12, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00222k_040	Oh, guardians are \n special beings that only \n appear for the royal \n family...	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00222k_050	Like that black thing \n that follows Cai around?	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00222k_060	I don't think I've seen \n anything like that for \n me.	[0, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00222k_070	I see.	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00222k_080	Well, don't worry. I'm \n sure one will show up \n for my queen sooner or \n later.	[0, 74, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00222k_090	The royal family always \n have guardians.	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00222k_100	Would it be a bad \n thing if one didn't \n show up for me?	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00223k_010	Queen Alua, do you \n remember anything about \n the Crystal Palace?	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00223k_020	Crystal Palace? Sorry...	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00223k_030	It's a place only the \n ruler is allowed to go.	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00223k_040	It's said a treasure of \n unparalleled beauty is \n held there.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00223k_050	Crystal Palace... \n Maybe I went there \n 100 years ago.	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00224k_010	Queen Alua, how are you \n feeling?	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00224k_020	I'm still fine. I keep \n saying I'm fine.	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00224k_030	My apologies, I was told \n to watch out for your \n health.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00224k_040	Cai is quite worried \n about you.	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00224k_050	Cai, he's the young boy \n I met earlier...	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00224k_060	Cai's the king, right? \n He seems so young...	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00224k_070	Oh, but he's quite a \n precocious young lad.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00224k_080	The kingdom was in \n turmoil until he came \n along and ascended to \n the throne.	[0, 74, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00224k_090	He was the one who \n brought peace back to \n Eto.	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00224k_100	I didn't know he was so \n capable.	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00224k_110	It sounds like Eto was \n doing fine without me... \n Maybe I should've stayed \n missing.	[0, 81, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00224k_120	Queen Alua, of course \n no-	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00224k_130	I'm sorry, that's not an \n easy thing to respond \n to. Forget I said it.	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00224k_140	Xicero, would you mind \n stopping by for a visit \n again sometime?	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00224k_150	I want to learn more \n about Eto and my past.	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00224k_160	Of course.	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00225k_010	Queen Alua, has anything \n happened since we last \n met?	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00225k_020	Say, for example-	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00225k_030	If you're wondering \n whether my guardian \n showed up, no. It \n hasn't.	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00225k_040	Hmm, perhaps even among \n the royal family there \n are differences in \n timing.	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00225k_050	King Cai's guardian \n appeared when he was \n born, long before \n ascending to the throne.	[0, 83, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00225k_060	...	[0, 3, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00225k_070	Well, don't worry. I'm \n sure one will show up \n for my queen sooner or \n later.	[0, 74, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00225k_080	I'm starting to worry \n I don't have one...	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00226k_010	Queen Alua, about the \n Crystal Palace, do you-	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00226k_020	I don't remember \n anything about it.	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00226k_030	Only the ruler is \n allowed to see the \n sacred treasure it \n contains.	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00226k_040	It's said to be of \n unparalleled beauty.	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00226k_050	What's the point of \n beauty if only one \n person is allowed to \n see it?	[0, 67, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00226k_060	Seems like such \n a waste...	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00230k_010	Queen Alua, you \n shouldn't wander alone.	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00230k_020	There are dangers even \n within the palace walls.	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00230k_030	Dangers, in here?	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00230k_040	Well, the intricate \n passages for one... 	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00230k_050	It would be so easy to \n get lost, or exhausted \n wandering them.	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00230k_060	And you're still \n recovering your health.	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00230k_070	I didn't know the \n palace was so large you \n could get lost in it...	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00230k_090	That must mean there \n are a lot of places I \n haven't visited yet.	[0, 63, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00231k_010	Queen Alua, do you \n remember the dark ocean \n and the threat it poses?	[0, 67, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00231k_020	You mean the swirling \n ocean at the bottom of \n the World Pillar?	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00231k_030	Yes, my queen. Although \n it appears stationary, \n it's actually rising.	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00231k_040	It's a dangerous threat, \n and what to do about it \n has been discussed in \n the Senate for years.	[0, 92, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00231k_050	If it's that bad, \n shouldn't they be doing \n something more than \n talking?	[0, 70, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00231k_060	Well, the threat isn't \n immediate.	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00231k_070	Time flows differently \n down there than up here \n in Eto.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00231k_080	The further you travel \n down the World Pillar, \n the slower time flows.	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00231k_090	The dark ocean won't \n reach us for another \n thousand years, by our \n best estimates.	[0, 80, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00231k_100	That's a relief to hear.	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00231k_110	Of course, there's no \n need for you to worry, \n my queen.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00231k_120	But what if there were \n people living further \n down the pillar?	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00232k_010	Auntie, how are you \n doing?	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00232k_020	I'm fine, thank you.	[0, 20, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00232k_030	That's great! I worry \n about you, you know.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00232k_040	I'm sorry to worry you \n so much. That seems like \n all I'm good at doing, \n making people worry.	[0, 91, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00232k_050	Is something wrong?	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00232k_060	All I do during the \n royal audience is listen \n to people talk...	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00232k_070	I'm sorry, Auntie, did \n someone say something to \n upset you?	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00232k_080	No, that's not the \n problem. It's just- Am I \n really doing any good \n here?	[0, 71, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00232k_090	The most important thing \n for you right now is to \n get better.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00232k_100	Don't worry about \n anything else, okay?	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00232k_110	Could I at least leave \n the palace and see the \n city?	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00232k_120	I want to see and hear \n the people of Eto with \n my own eyes and ears.	[0, 67, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00232k_130	There'll be plenty of \n time for that later, you \n really need your rest \n now.	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00232k_140	Save the trip to the \n city as something to \n look forward to when you \n get better.	[0, 78, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00232k_150	Please, Auntie... If \n anything were to happen \n to you-	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00232k_160	I know, I shouldn't have \n asked in the first \n place.	[0, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00233k_010	Queen Alua, you \n shouldn't wander alone.	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00233k_020	I know, I could get lost \n wandering the palace.	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00233k_030	Exactly, my queen.	[0, 18, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00233k_040	You should be careful, \n even in the palace.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00233k_050	If I can't go outside, \n at least I should be \n allowed to wander \n the palace...	[0, 75, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00234k_010	Queen Alua, do you \n remember the dark ocean \n and the threat it poses?	[0, 67, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00234k_020	The dark ocean rising up \n the World Pillar that \n doesn't pose an \n immediate threat to Eto?	[0, 87, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00234k_030	That's correct. And do \n you remember how time \n flows down there?	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00234k_040	Yes, it's slower down \n there, so Eto still has \n plenty of time.	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00234k_050	But... What if there are \n people living down \n there?	[0, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00234k_060	Queen Alua, your \n responsibility is to the \n people of Eto.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00234k_070	You shouldn't worry \n about what ifs and \n possibilities beyond \n our borders.	[0, 72, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00234k_080	Understand?	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00234k_090	Of course. My first \n responsibility is to the \n people here.	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00234k_100	Though I've barely met \n any of these people I'm \n supposed to be \n responsible for...	[0, 80, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00240k_010	Queen Alua, I wonder if \n you remember \n something...	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00240k_020	The day you were chosen \n to rule Eto?	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00240k_030	No, I'm sorry I don't.	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00240k_040	I see...	[0, 8, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00240k_050	Well, your case \n was quite unique.	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00240k_060	Usually, when the old \n ruler passes...	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00240k_070	The Senate act on \n a divine revelation...	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00240k_080	And search the children \n of Eto for the next \n ruler, who they bring \n back to the castle.	[0, 85, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00240k_090	Really? That's how I \n became queen?	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00240k_100	Yes, though, like \n I said, your case \n was unique.	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00240k_110	You were chosen after \n you were already \n starting to grow.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00240k_120	The Senate debated \n whether or not to \n follow the revelation.	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00240k_130	More than anyone, \n I think you were unhappy \n about being the new \n queen.	[0, 69, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00240k_140	After all, your life \n in Eto was upheaved \n and you were forced \n to rule.	[0, 69, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00240k_150	I wonder how \n I must've felt...?	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00240k_160	That was over 100 years \n ago, my family must be \n all gone by now...	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00241k_010	Queen Alua, how goes it? \n Anything new with your \n day?	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00241k_020	No, nothing new. Seems \n like I keep running into \n the same old people too.	[0, 72, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00241k_030	I want to talk to \n someone new, to get out \n and talk to the people \n of Eto.	[0, 72, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00241k_040	Only a select few are \n able to set sight on \n your noble face, my \n queen.	[0, 69, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00241k_050	But worry not, the \n people of Eto are quite \n happy.	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00241k_060	They're grateful for \n everything you and King \n Cai are doing for them.	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00241k_070	Grateful, for what? \n I'm not doing anything.	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00242k_010	Queen Alua, a question, \n if you don't mind?	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00242k_020	Ask whatever is on your \n mind, though I can't \n guarantee I know the \n answer.	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00242k_030	A device you had with \n you, back 100 years \n ago...	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00242k_040	Device?	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00242k_050	A red crystal - a \n communication device \n capable of recording \n information...	[0, 74, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00242k_060	I'm sorry, I wish I knew \n what you were talking \n about...	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00242k_070	If you should happen to \n remember anything about \n it, would you please let \n me know?	[0, 81, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00242k_080	A communication device \n made from red crystal... \n What's it for?	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00243k_010	Queen Alua, I wonder if \n you remember \n something...	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00243k_020	The day you were chosen \n to rule Eto?	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00243k_030	Yes, you told me about \n it not that long ago.	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00243k_040	Of course, my apologies.	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00243k_050	You said the way I was \n chosen was rare?	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00243k_070	Hold on just a second. \n Tell me what was so rare \n about my case!	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00244k_010	Queen Alua, how goes it? \n Anything new with your \n day?	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00244k_020	As you can see - same \n old, same old.	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00244k_030	I do the same things, \n see the same people, \n hear the same things...	[0, 66, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00244k_040	Even just for one day, \n I'd love to go out and \n see how the people of \n Eto are getting along.	[0, 90, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00244k_050	Worry not, my queen, \n they are quite happy.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00244k_060	Queen Alua, does \n something stress you?	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00244k_070	I almost wish \n something was... \n It would alleviate \n the boredom.	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00245k_010	Queen Alua, a question, \n if you don't mind?	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00245k_020	What is it?	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00245k_030	A device you had with \n you, back 100 years \n ago...	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00245k_040	The red crystal \n communication device?	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00245k_050	Sorry, I don't remember \n anything about it.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00245k_060	If you should happen to \n remember anything about \n it, would you please let \n me know?	[0, 81, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00245k_070	It doesn't matter how \n many times he asks, \n I don't remember it.	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00250k_010	You seem bored, Queen \n Alua.	[0, 27, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00250k_020	I am bored. Every day is \n the same.	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00250k_030	If you should like a \n distraction, perhaps a \n pet would help? A puppy, \n or a kitten?	[0, 81, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00250k_040	Hmm, guess if I had to \n choose, I would go with \n the kitten, I'm more of \n a cat person.	[0, 84, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00250k_050	Cats are impossible to \n read and always do their \n own thing...	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00250k_060	But I guess I identify \n that part of myself in \n them.	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00250k_070	Has my queen ever raised \n a cat before?	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00250k_080	Hmm, I can't recall, but \n it feels like I have.	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00250k_090	It would be my pleasure \n to present you with a \n kitten, should you like.	[0, 70, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00250k_100	No... I'm fine, thank \n you.	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00250k_110	I'm not sure I would be \n the best person to take \n care of it.	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00250k_120	I understand, my queen.	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00250k_130	It's just a faint \n memory, but it does \n feel like I've lived \n with a cat before.	[0, 77, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00251k_010	Say, have you seen \n Xicero lately? I wonder \n if anything happened to \n him...	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00251k_020	I'm sure Xicero is just \n busy. He is the Senate \n Chancellor, after all.	[0, 69, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00251k_030	How long has he been \n Chancellor?	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00251k_040	I believe he rose to the \n position not long after \n you disappeared...	[0, 67, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00251k_050	So I'd say just under a \n hundred years.	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00251k_060	He was said to have been \n a very shrewd \n politician, even from \n when he was young.	[0, 79, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00251k_070	In fact, there was only \n one person who could've \n rivaled him.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00251k_080	It was his friend... Oh, \n what was the name?	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00251k_090	I'm sorry, I can't \n remember, but he was \n said to have died in an \n accident.	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep22_00251k_100	It all happened so long \n ago...	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
