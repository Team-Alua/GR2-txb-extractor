ep02_00040k_070	He's not playing it up.	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep02_00040k_080	Why does Misai \n always have to \n be such a downer?	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep02_00100	Now that I can shift gravity, it's a quick hop to the bird coop.	[0, 64, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

ep02_00132k_060	Somehow I doubt \n that...	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep02_00132k_070	You can leave the rest \n of this island to us.	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep02_00132k_080	We're relying on \n you for the islands \n we can't handle.	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep02_00132k_090	Sure! I'll be right back \n with some ore then!	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

ep02_00151	Shift Gravity and Fall \n to the Rock's Face	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep02_00152	Okay, time to stop shifting and get back on the ground.	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep02_00153	For a Gravity Shifter, a wall is just as good as a floor!	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep02_00155	I wonder if I can land on that narrow spot there.	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep02_00156	Last is up.	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
