006d27f3	What!?	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
02029d92	That explains the \n unopened bottle I \n found too.	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
0304c91a	Are you being \n serious?	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
0486bec1	Wait...	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
04c7a03b	*Gulp* \n ... \n GAAAGH! \n What the heck is this!	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
069036cf	O-Oh... Well, that would \n be weird, wouldn't it.	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
0895985d	All of that just to \n get out of training? \n Really...	[0, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
0b4a9f98	You opened the bottle, \n drank it...	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
0c4ccb20	Because if you \n are, I don't think \n you've thought \n things out.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
0d0fa341	*Cough* *Cough*	[0, 15, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
0dcec0c7	Why would you haul \n the rookie out to \n the training site?	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
0fd838d5	And what about his head? \n Are you saying he \n whacked himself?	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
101791c6	I think you need to \n collect a little more \n information.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
10fbb75f	And so the Crate Case was finally solved.	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
11dd9a63	And I hauled the crate \n with him in it out to \n the training ground.	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
1492a19e	And was so shocked by \n the taste I threw it.	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
153879e2	He's the victim.	[0, 16, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
1943ba65	Not being able to drink myself, \n I stayed behind and had a chance to reflect on the case. \n The more I thought about it, the more I realized that \n Bulbosa's drinking habit was the true culprit.	[0, 189, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
195f93cc	Oh, well... \n Why would you?	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
1a4f8ded	We're done!	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
1ddaa3a4	I was peeking out of \n the crate when you \n did...	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
20f4844d	And you, inspector, \n you need to cut people \n a little slack.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
228bbc6b	Well, that wraps up \n the case!	[0, 29, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
22a795d2	If it was me, \n why would I stuff \n my own brother in \n a crate?	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
26d8aca8	Do you have any \n evidence to support \n your bold claim?	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
27c87dee	The rookie is \n behind all this!	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
293c8753	I understand wanting \n out of training, but \n running's not the \n answer.	[0, 67, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
2bd3be71	Let's go celebrate and \n make up with a drink.	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
2bef97d8	So you spread rumors \n about the training \n and hid the crate to \n interfere with it!	[0, 79, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
2d683411	So I hid in the \n warehouse after work \n and started throwing \n the explosives away.	[0, 78, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
307f27cb	The rookie is \n behind all this!	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
36adc32d	And when the rookie \n found out, you knocked \n him out!	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
371e87b9	Chaz	[0, 4, 'GillSansStd-UltraBold']
3ce3f5d4	The Inspector	[0, 13, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
3ff5c533	Then you hid him in \n that crate and hauled \n him out to the training \n site.	[0, 71, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
4304a0cf	You finally get \n accepted into the \n police force, and this \n happens!	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
4498d44e	The inspector is \n behind all this!	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
46b9a60a	And that's how the \n bottle hit the \n rookie's head!	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
4c4ca2d5	I'm sorry too. I guess \n my training program is \n a little severe...	[0, 64, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
4f01a910	I must've lost \n consciousness in the \n crate.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
5155a6b2	The Rookie	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
55be945f	This whole case \n is just one big \n mystery!	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
5849ab16	And the bottle must've \n broken after hitting \n the floor.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
5a590714	The warehouse guard \n is behind all this!	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
5aeec634	...	[0, 3, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
5e069765	Let's just rethink \n things and start over \n from the beginning.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
609cb429	Aww, why me?	[0, 12, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
6642c6e3	But...	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
665e9f4a	The inspector is \n behind all this!	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
674e996b	You're giving up now!?	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
67995e68	The Guard	[0, 9, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
692599a9	That should be enough...	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
69e4b62f	You misappropriated \n police equipment.	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
70a89706	So I dropped the \n bottle and hid in the \n empty crate.	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
726d9baf	Footsteps? Someone's coming! \n I've gotta hide.	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
76bfd9ba	Oh, well...	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
79f0990c	Those footsteps \n must've been me.	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
7a67408f	I heard someone \n coming...	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
7dc2aac2	The inspector is \n behind all this!	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
7f07dcc0	Do you have any \n evidence to support \n your bold claim?	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
801ed26a	The Rookie	[0, 10, 'GillSansStd-UltraBold']
83accfab	He obviously didn't \n have anything to \n do with this.	[0, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
88f58761	*Sigh*	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
897e2a79	I-I'm sorry!	[0, 12, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
8c26765c	M-Me? How?	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
929ad9da	Chaz	[0, 4, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
92c62c7f	The rookie is \n behind all this!	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
955dcea6	Maybe not...	[0, 12, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
9aee9de9	Sorry, I know I \n screwed up.	[0, 27, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
9d9250b4	I think you need to \n collect a little more \n information.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
9e10118c	I think you need to \n collect a little more \n information.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
a0aecab6	I think you need to \n collect a little more \n information.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
a1313e61	I think you need to \n collect a little more \n information.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
a2253e6d	The Guard	[0, 9, 'GillSansStd-UltraBold']
a34643f5	On the day before \n training, while I was \n draining the \n explosives...	[0, 66, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
a456318b	That's why the \n inventory was off!	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
a7581392	You can't just go \n fingering people \n without evidence.	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
a9f6ccbc	You're just grasping \n at straws...	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
afe9af2e	You don't like Chaz.	[0, 20, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
b4009b5e	You don't like Chaz.	[0, 20, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
b4e4c1f7	He was always going on \n about how proud he was \n of you.	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
bd2cc4fd	...He was?	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
bd489d64	Do you have any \n evidence to support \n your bold claim?	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
c2d82c57	Don't go jumping to \n conclusions now.	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
c3648fd3	What's wrong?	[0, 13, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
c8ff0188	Oh, uh... \n Not sure.	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
cb202f5d	M-Me? How?	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ccac91d9	Guess there's nothing \n left to do but go out \n for a drink.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
cddba6	The Inspector	[0, 13, 'GillSansStd-UltraBold']
ceacda73	But there he went, wrapping up the case by \n suggesting alcohol to smooth things over...	[0, 86, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
d0909e24	So you spread rumors \n about the training...	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
d147048e	Me!? What are \n you implying?	[0, 27, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
d1dcc3ae	Chaz is behind \n all this!	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
d4683163	He was probably hiding \n in the crate to get out \n of Chaz's training.	[0, 66, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
d55da55b	Family...	[0, 9, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
d67d36f7	I thought if he didn't \n have the explosives, \n he'd have to cancel \n the training.	[0, 77, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
d9d8a02a	And threw all that \n glass on the floor \n to interfere with it!	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
da96cdc5	Yeah, why? \n And don't forget, \n I have an alibi.	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dac87170	I think you need to \n collect a little more \n information.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ddb03369	But he's so fishy! \n I'm running with \n my gut on this one.	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dea5a761	Don't take it so hard, \n you were just thinking \n about what was best \n for your trainees.	[0, 84, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dfc538fd	I couldn't bear \n another day of \n Chaz's training.	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
e15aae9c	Causing some of the \n glass to fly up and \n land in his clothes.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
e220a330	If it was me, \n why would I stuff \n my own brother in \n a crate?	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
e7eda967	That's an \n understatement.	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
eb68a536	Oh, well... \n Why would you?	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ef53c969	You know your brother \n thinks the world of \n you!	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
fb3dbcbb	The warehouse guard \n is behind all this!	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
fb7e9e35	*Hick* \n Ooh, there's what I need.	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
fce8bbac	I think you need to \n collect a little more \n information.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00100	That must be the police warehouse.	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00100k_010	Kat, thank you for the \n other day.	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00100k_020	Is that trainee we \n found in the box okay?	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00100k_030	Yes, he's back on his \n feet and back at work.	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00100k_040	I just checked in on \n him over at the police \n warehouse.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00100k_050	Did you ever figure \n out how he ended up \n in that crate?	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00100k_060	I was hoping to get an \n answer from him...	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00100k_070	But he doesn't \n remember anything that \n happened that day.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00100k_080	It's obvious he \n didn't want to end \n up in that box.	[0, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00100k_090	We have to get to \n the bottom of this.	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00100k_100	There's a possibility \n this is all part of a \n bigger crime.	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00100k_110	Got it. And I'm \n guessing you've hit a \n bit of a roadblock in \n your investigation?	[0, 79, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00100k_120	Ah, I see!	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00101	Find the Truth	[0, 14, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00102	Bulbosa: \n Hey, don't forget about me.	[0, 9, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [9, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00103	Bulbosa: \n Could we just walk there?	[0, 9, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [9, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00104	Bulbosa: \n Where are you going?	[0, 9, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [9, 29, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00110k_010	Boss! What are you \n doing here?	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00110k_020	Chaz, I know you feel \n responsible for the \n rookie - he was your \n trainee, after all.	[0, 82, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00110k_030	But you're letting your \n desire to solve the case \n cloud your judgment.	[0, 69, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00110k_040	You've been working hard \n to fill Syd's shoes ever \n since he vanished.	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00110k_050	But you're too close \n to this incident to \n remain objective.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00110k_060	You're trying to keep a \n level head - I get it. \n But you know and I know \n that's not possible.	[0, 91, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00110k_070	You should leave this \n case to me and the \n little lady here.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00110k_080	You're right, boss. \n Alright, it's now in \n your capable hands.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00120k_010	The first part of any \n good investigation is \n fact-finding.	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00120k_020	Getting more \n information out of \n our rookie victim is \n the first step.	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00120k_030	Then don't forget to \n question who might \n be involved.	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00120k_040	Yes sir!	[0, 8, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00120k_050	Looks like I got roped \n back into helping the \n police...	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00120k_060	Though it's nice to \n have a real case to \n solve instead of that \n training stuff.	[0, 77, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_010	You're the detective \n who was in that crate?	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_020	Sorry to bother you so \n soon after your \n recovery, but we have \n a few questions.	[0, 77, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_030	I wish I could answer \n them, but I don't \n remember anything.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_040	What's the last thing \n you do remember?	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_050	Well, I remember being \n in the supply warehouse.	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_060	Hmm, maybe we should \n go have a look around \n the warehouse then.	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_070	Lead on, rookie!	[0, 16, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_080	Right this way.	[0, 15, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_090	There's a lot of \n stuff packed in here.	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_100	Yeah, this is the \n warehouse where we \n keep anything we \n might need.	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_110	You work here?	[0, 14, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_120	Yes, I manage the \n warehouse's inventory.	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_130	Do you remember what \n you were doing on the \n day of the incident?	[0, 63, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_140	Just the usual \n inventory. But...	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_150	I do remember a \n whack on the head, \n then everything \n going black.	[0, 63, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_160	This whole thing \n reeks of foul play.	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_170	Someone probably went in \n that warehouse and \n whacked you on the head.	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_180	The rebels have been \n getting bolder. Could \n be their doing...	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_190	They'd jump at any \n chance they could get \n to hurt the police.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00130k_200	Alright, let's \n move on!	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_010	What are you doing \n here? That warehouse \n is off limits to \n non-police personnel.	[0, 78, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_020	This little lady is a \n primary investigator \n on the Crate Case.	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_030	Captain Bulbosa. \n You're looking into \n my brother's case?	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_040	Brother?	[0, 8, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_050	The victim was my older \n brother. We're both in \n the police force.	[0, 64, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_060	I just dropped by to \n check on the \n warehouse.	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_070	Hey, you two are \n famous in the \n department.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_080	You both come from a \n long line of respected \n officers.	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_090	As I recall, you \n graduated academy and \n entered the force \n before your brother.	[0, 77, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_100	Since then, you've \n been working as an \n internal affairs \n inspector.	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_110	Just between us, \n that must make \n your job a little \n difficult.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_120	Not at all, I make it \n a point never to talk \n police work with my \n brother.	[0, 72, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_130	So you two don't see \n each other outside of \n work much?	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_140	Oh, no, we see each \n other all the time. \n We both still live \n with our parents.	[0, 76, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_150	Have you noticed \n anything different \n about your brother \n lately then?	[0, 67, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_160	Well, he didn't come \n home the night before \n the incident.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_170	It was the first time \n he ever spent the \n night outside without \n calling us.	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_180	Then I think it's safe \n to assume the rookie \n went missing the night \n before his training day.	[0, 91, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_190	Whoever did this \n could've been \n targeting the family.	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00140k_200	Alright, let's \n move on!	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00150k_010	Captain Bulbosa!	[0, 16, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00150k_020	Relax, son, we're just \n here to ask about the \n Crate Case.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00150k_030	Little lady, this \n officer is another \n rookie assigned to the \n warehouse.	[0, 70, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00150k_040	Have you noticed \n anything out of the \n ordinary?	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00150k_050	Well, the crate \n inventory didn't \n add up.	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00150k_060	What!? That sounds \n like a big deal.	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00150k_070	You're telling me. The \n internal affairs \n inspector was breathing \n down my neck about it.	[0, 86, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00150k_080	But come on, people make \n mistakes, you know? No \n need to make a stink \n about it.	[0, 78, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00150k_090	Something tells me \n this guy's not \n promotion material...	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00150k_100	Missing crates... \n That must be a clue.	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00150k_110	We can't discount \n misappropriation. There \n could be a conspiracy to \n keep the rookie quiet.	[0, 89, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00150k_120	Alright, let's \n move on!	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00160k_010	I don't get why the \n rookie was stuffed \n in a crate...	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00160k_020	It does seem like \n we're out of leads.	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00160k_030	I can't believe I let \n this happen to one of \n my trainees.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00160k_040	Don't worry, I'll \n solve this case or my \n name isn't Bulbosa.	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00160k_050	I hate to admit it...	[0, 21, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00160k_060	But the perpetrator \n could be someone \n jealous of Chaz...	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00160k_070	Let's keep looking \n into this.	[0, 29, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00170k_010	I think we've got enough \n information.	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00170k_020	According to that \n inspector, the rookie \n went missing the day \n before the training.	[0, 81, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00170k_030	The rookie mentioned \n getting whacked on the \n back of the head in the \n warehouse.	[0, 78, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00170k_040	Don't forget about \n the missing crate.	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00170k_050	Hmm, that might be \n enough to go on.	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00170k_060	Okay, let's move on to \n the next step of our \n investigation.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00180k_010	I've gathered \n everyone involved.	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00180k_020	First, the victim - a \n rookie with the force.	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00180k_030	Yeah, that's me.	[0, 16, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00180k_040	Next, the other \n warehouse guard.	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00180k_050	That would be me.	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00180k_060	And the internal affairs \n inspector - brother of \n the victim.	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00180k_070	How am I involved? \n I just dropped by to \n check on the warehouse.	[0, 63, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00180k_080	Fine, if it helps, \n I'm in.	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00180k_090	Lieutenant Chaz, we'll \n need whatever \n information you've \n managed to gather.	[0, 74, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00180k_100	Sure thing, boss.	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00180k_110	Okay, little lady, \n better get started with \n the questioning.	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00180k_120	Why me!?	[0, 8, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00180k_130	I can't question them \n and watch their \n reactions at the same \n time.	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00180k_140	Are you saying the \n criminal is one of these \n three officers?	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00180k_150	That's exactly what I'm \n saying. Figuring out \n which one is up to you.	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00200k_010	I felt a pain rushing \n through my head \n when it happened. \n It still hurts.	[0, 71, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00200k_020	Wow! \n Look at that \n big bump!	[0, 27, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00200k_030	If someone whacked him \n from behind...	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00200k_040	They're probably \n bigger than the \n victim.	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00200k_050	Not necessarily. \n Couldn't they just \n use a big stick \n or something?	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00200k_060	Hey, you're right! \n I didn't think of that.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00200k_070	If we can find a \n weapon, it would help \n our investigation.	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00210k_010	I know who did it!	[0, 18, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00210k_020	You do?	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00210k_030	There was glass \n in the rookie's \n clothes, right?	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00210k_040	Yeah.	[0, 5, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00210k_050	Y-You don't mean...	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00210k_060	The day before the \n incident, you were \n scouring the warehouse \n for booze.	[0, 71, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00210k_070	You found a Molotov \n cocktail, and, mistaking \n it for liquor, popped it \n open.	[0, 75, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00210k_080	When you took a sip, you \n realized your mistake \n and, in surprise, tossed \n the bottle.	[0, 83, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00210k_090	The bottle flew off...	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00210k_100	And hit the rookie in \n the back of the head, \n maybe?	[0, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00210k_110	You had me going \n until you threw \n in that "maybe."	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00210k_120	I did throw a bottle.	[0, 21, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00210k_130	But I threw it after \n hours when no one else \n was in the warehouse.	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00210k_140	O-Oh...	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00220k_010	What was I doing the day \n before the incident?	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00220k_020	Well, I was working the \n warehouse with the other \n rookie, as usual.	[0, 66, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00220k_030	And after you were done?	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00220k_040	I-I'm sorry, I don't \n remember.	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00220k_050	Fair enough, you did \n take a hearty whack on \n the back of the head.	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00230k_010	Lieutenant Chaz's \n training program?	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00230k_020	Well, I was scheduled \n to attend.	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00230k_030	I guess you couldn't, \n given what happened.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00230k_040	I'm sorry I assumed \n you just overslept.	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00240k_010	O-Oh, th-that? \n Well, uh...	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00240k_020	What's wrong?	[0, 13, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00240k_030	N-Nothing at all.	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00240k_040	He's actin' funny, good \n work, little lady.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00250k_010	A missing crate?	[0, 16, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00250k_020	I-I don't know a thing \n about it!	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00250k_030	Why are you so nervous?	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00250k_040	I think you know \n where it is.	[0, 29, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00250k_050	N-No way!	[0, 9, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00250k_060	Permission is required \n for any and all \n equipment leaving the \n warehouse.	[0, 71, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00250k_070	There's no way a \n rookie could just \n walk off with it.	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00250k_080	Hmm, guess not.	[0, 15, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00250k_090	I was an explosive crate \n short for training, \n so I asked the rookie to \n bring one.	[0, 80, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00250k_100	I miscounted when \n preparing the crates, \n that was my fault.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00250k_110	But that would mean...	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00250k_120	The other rookie was \n in that crate the \n whole time?	[0, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00250k_130	So you hauled the \n crate with the rookie \n stuffed inside out to \n the training site?	[0, 80, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00250k_140	I guess so. Come to \n think of it, it was a \n little on the heavy \n side.	[0, 67, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00250k_150	I grabbed it from \n the usual place, \n so I didn't think \n twice about it.	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00250k_160	The rookie was in the \n explosive crate meant \n for Chaz's training \n program.	[0, 72, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00250k_170	And the guard working \n the warehouse is the one \n who brought it to the \n training site.	[0, 83, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00255k_010	I've got a hunch, \n little lady.	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00255k_020	Don't you think \n something's suspicious \n about the training \n crates?	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00260k_010	What was I doing inside \n the crate, you say?	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00260k_020	You don't remember \n anything?	[0, 28, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00260k_030	Sorry, not a thing.	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00260k_040	Can you blame him? \n He was knocked out.	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00270k_010	Glass...	[0, 8, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00270k_020	Now that you mention it, \n the doctor said he \n removed glass from my \n clothing.	[0, 75, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00270k_030	Glass in your \n clothing?	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00270k_040	This is a shard he \n found.	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00270k_050	It's tinted, and it's \n curved a bit.	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00270k_060	I doubt it came from a \n window.	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00270k_070	That looks like a piece \n from a Molotov cocktail \n bottle.	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00270k_080	The glass I found on the \n floor looked like that.	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00270k_090	A Molotov cocktail?	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00270k_100	No mistake. I remember \n sweeping up the bottle's \n warning label.	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00270k_110	Glass all over \n the floor.	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00270k_120	And in the \n rookie's clothes...	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00270k_130	I think we're getting \n close to our answer.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00275k_010	I've got a hunch, \n little lady.	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00275k_020	Don't you think \n something's suspicious \n about the empty Molotov \n bottle?	[0, 70, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00280k_010	A Molotov cocktail?	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00280k_020	I'm assuming you keep \n those in the warehouse, \n right?	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00280k_030	Let's check it out.	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00280k_040	This is one of \n the bottles.	[0, 27, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00280k_050	Looks pretty ordinary.	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00280k_060	They're usually stored \n in crates.	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00280k_070	Hm?	[0, 3, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00280k_080	What is it, boss?	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00280k_090	Nothing... Just feels \n like I've seen that \n bottle before.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00280k_110	Shoot, wish I could \n remember where.	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00285k_010	A Molotov cocktail?	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00285k_020	I'm assuming you keep \n those in the warehouse, \n right?	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00285k_030	Let's check it out.	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00285k_040	This is one of \n the bottles.	[0, 27, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00285k_050	Wait...	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00285k_060	What is it, boss?	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00285k_070	I've seen this bottle \n before...	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00285k_080	Oh, right!	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00285k_090	I remember thinking \n it was booze and \n taking a sip!	[0, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00285k_100	Y-You what!?	[0, 12, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00285k_110	I was on my way home \n from the bar, and wanted \n one last nip before \n calling it a night...	[0, 87, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00285k_120	So I dropped by the \n warehouse to see if \n anything would fit \n the bill.	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00285k_130	And you thought the \n bottles were filled \n with drinking alcohol.	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00285k_140	Boy did I pay for my \n mistake. My stomach was \n wrecked the next day.	[0, 66, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00285k_150	What did you do \n with the bottle?	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00285k_160	Out of shock, \n I tossed it.	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00285k_170	Well, now we know \n where the glass on \n the floor came from.	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00285k_180	Sounds like I'm the one \n to blame for that.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00285k_190	I guess I did have \n a little too much \n to drink...	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00290k_010	Alright, now we know \n why there was glass \n on the floor.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00290k_020	But why was glass found \n in the rookie's \n clothing?	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00290k_030	You got me...	[0, 13, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00290k_040	I was there after hours, \n so there shouldn't have \n been anyone else there.	[0, 72, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00290k_050	Oh...	[0, 5, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00290k_060	What?	[0, 5, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00290k_070	Nothing...	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00300k_010	I was shocked when I \n heard my brother got \n attacked.	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00300k_020	We come from a proud \n family of officers. He \n should've been more \n vigilant.	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00300k_030	Don't be too hard \n on your brother. \n He could've really \n been hurt.	[0, 64, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00300k_040	Sibling rivalry... \n Feels like I've \n seen something \n like this before.	[0, 67, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00320k_010	I went straight home \n after work the day of \n the incident.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00320k_020	You didn't stop \n anywhere?	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00320k_030	Nope, and my parents \n can verify that.	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00320k_040	Guess he's got \n an alibi.	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00320k_050	You and your brother \n work at the same place, \n but you don't go home \n together?	[0, 76, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00320k_060	No, we work two \n different departments \n and have two different \n schedules.	[0, 71, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00320k_070	And I can't go giving \n him special treatment.	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00320k_080	No, I guess not...	[0, 18, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00320k_090	He is an adult, \n so I wasn't worried \n when he didn't \n call home.	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00320k_100	Hmm, these brothers \n don't seem on the \n closest of terms.	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00330k_010	About this whole \n incident...	[0, 28, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00330k_020	I think Lieutenant \n Chaz's training regimen \n might have something to \n do with it.	[0, 78, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00330k_030	What are you \n implying?	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00330k_040	I've had doubts about \n your training program in \n the past.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00330k_050	And we've received \n claims that the program \n is unfairly intense.	[0, 63, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00330k_060	An officer is only as \n good as the training \n they receive.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00330k_070	If they can't handle \n training, how are they \n going to handle things \n out in the field?	[0, 84, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00330k_080	What would you know \n about what it's like out \n there!?	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00330k_090	Calm down, Chaz. \n Remember he IS \n an inspector.	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00330k_100	And I think we can all \n agree your training \n program is intense.	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00330k_110	But that's just Chaz's \n way of trying to fill \n the void Syd left \n behind.	[0, 70, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00330k_120	Chaz is a smart thinker \n and a hard worker.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00330k_130	Heck, his hard work is \n the reason I've got \n nothing to do all day \n but sit at my desk.	[0, 84, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00330k_140	Hmm, sounds like there \n are issues inside the \n police department.	[0, 63, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00335k_010	I've got a hunch, \n little lady.	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00335k_020	Don't you think \n something's suspicious \n about Chaz's intensity?	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00340k_010	Although the recruits \n hate the training \n program, it does bring \n results.	[0, 71, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00340k_020	So you admit Chaz might \n not be on the wrong \n track?	[0, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00340k_030	Everyone wants to be \n liked. It's not easy \n being tough on your \n subordinates.	[0, 75, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00340k_040	But an organization \n sometimes needs a \n person who can be \n tough. Disliked, even.	[0, 78, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00340k_050	Disliked, huh...	[0, 16, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00340k_060	Could someone be \n out to get Chaz?	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00350k_010	I've been getting \n reports that the \n inventory is off, so I \n came by to inquire why.	[0, 81, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00350k_020	No matter how many times \n we count, the numbers \n don't add up.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00350k_030	Isn't that right?	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00350k_040	I-I wouldn't know \n a thing about it!	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00350k_050	What a strange \n reaction...	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00350k_060	Are you the one \n misappropriating our \n equipment?	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00350k_070	N-No, I'd never do that!	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00350k_080	Permission is required \n for any and all \n equipment leaving the \n warehouse.	[0, 71, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00350k_090	There's no way a \n rookie could just \n walk off with it.	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00350k_100	Hmm, guess not.	[0, 15, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00350k_110	I was an explosive crate \n short for training, \n so I asked the rookie to \n bring one.	[0, 80, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00350k_120	I miscounted when \n preparing the crates, \n that was my fault.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00350k_130	But that would mean...	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00350k_140	The other rookie was \n in that crate the \n whole time?	[0, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00350k_150	So you hauled the \n crate with the rookie \n stuffed inside out to \n the training site?	[0, 80, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00350k_160	I guess so. Come to \n think of it, it was a \n little on the heavy \n side.	[0, 67, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00350k_170	I grabbed it from \n the usual place, \n so I didn't think \n twice about it.	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00350k_180	The rookie was in the \n explosive crate meant \n for Chaz's training \n program.	[0, 72, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00350k_190	And the guard working \n the warehouse is the one \n who brought it to the \n training site.	[0, 83, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00360k_010	A crate used for \n training? \n I wouldn't know \n anything about that.	[0, 63, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00360k_020	But I'm not in charge of \n training the recruits.	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00360k_030	No, I guess not...	[0, 18, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00370k_010	Missing crates, \n glass all over the \n floor...	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00370k_020	It sounds like you \n can't handle your \n job very well.	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00370k_030	S-Sorry, sir.	[0, 13, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00370k_040	You can lecture him \n about taking \n responsibility after \n we wrap this case up.	[0, 75, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00380k_010	An empty Molotov \n cocktail bottle? \n Never seen such \n a thing.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00380k_020	No, I guess you \n wouldn't, not being \n out in the field.	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00380k_030	I believe Lieutenant \n Chaz is in charge of \n hazardous materials.	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00380k_040	I'll be sure to make a \n note of his failing.	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00380k_050	Go right ahead. \n I accept full \n responsibility.	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00380k_060	Ah, it's just an empty \n bottle - not like it \n could start a fire or \n anything.	[0, 75, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00380k_070	Seems like the \n inspector's got a bone \n to pick with Chaz.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00390k_010	I guess I can't blame \n you for the glass.	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00390k_020	Everyone makes \n mistakes, sir!	[0, 29, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00390k_030	...Thank you for your \n understanding.	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00390k_040	Captain Bulbosa...	[0, 18, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00390k_050	Please submit an \n inventory report \n as soon as you \n get back to HQ.	[0, 64, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00390k_060	Fine...	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00400k_010	Who would assault him?	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00400k_020	He's such a nice guy, \n I can't imagine anyone \n hating him.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00400k_030	He does seem \n pretty nice.	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00400k_040	Doesn't seem like \n he has any \n enemies, does it?	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00420k_010	I was working the \n warehouse with him the \n day of the incident.	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00420k_020	We didn't need to \n prepare anything for \n training until the \n next morning.	[0, 71, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00420k_030	So I left early and \n went back to the dorm \n to catch some sleep \n before the training.	[0, 82, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00420k_040	I'm sure the people \n back at the dorm can \n verify your alibi.	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00420k_050	Say, Captain Bulbosa, \n didn't we run into \n each other that day?	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00420k_060	The day before \n training?	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00420k_070	Yeah, you're right. I \n came by to drop off \n some paperwork.	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00420k_080	But I had a little too \n much to drink.	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00420k_090	On the job!?	[0, 12, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00420k_100	No, no, AFTER the job.	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00420k_110	I don't remember \n that night...	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00420k_120	But I do remember a \n horrible stomachache \n the next day.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00420k_130	That's all we need to \n hear about that...	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00420k_140	So the rookie and the \n guard were both \n registered for Chaz's \n training program.	[0, 77, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00420k_150	Would that mean the \n guard is the last one \n to see the rookie \n before the incident?	[0, 80, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00425k_010	I've got a hunch, \n little lady.	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00425k_020	Don't you think \n something's suspicious \n about Chaz's training?	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00430k_010	I was supposed to join \n Chaz's training \n program too.	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00430k_020	We wanted to prepare \n for it, so we arranged \n to meet before.	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00430k_030	When he didn't \n show up, I went \n on alone.	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00430k_040	The rookie was \n already missing.	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00430k_050	So I had to prepare \n everything for \n training on my own.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00430k_060	I made a few mistakes, \n and Lieutenant Chaz \n rode me for them.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00430k_070	To make up for it, the \n lieutenant decided to \n double my training \n load.	[0, 69, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00430k_080	Sorry, man...	[0, 13, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00440k_010	Oh boy, Lieutenant \n Chaz's training \n program is a \n nightmare!	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00440k_020	He'd always ride me - \n making me stay after \n for further training.	[0, 64, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00440k_030	We hated training, \n didn't we?	[0, 29, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00440k_040	...	[0, 3, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00440k_050	Someday all that \n training'll save your \n butt out in the field.	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00440k_060	Uhm...	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00440k_070	What?	[0, 5, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00440k_080	Never mind, \n it's nothing.	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00450k_010	The missing crate?	[0, 18, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00450k_020	Not you too? The \n inspector just got \n done riding me for \n that!	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00450k_030	He got that upset?	[0, 18, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00450k_040	Boy did he ever. \n It's not like we were \n missing that much.	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00450k_050	Just a little here, \n a little there... \n But he really took \n it out on us.	[0, 70, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00450k_060	You WERE in charge \n of inventory...	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00450k_070	Taking a little here \n and there hardly \n sounds like the work \n of a big-time thief.	[0, 79, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00460k_010	We were storing crates \n with explosives for \n training in the \n warehouse.	[0, 69, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00460k_020	It was my job to haul \n crates out to the \n training site.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00460k_030	And the rookie was in \n one of them...	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00460k_040	Did you notice anything \n strange when you were \n hauling crates?	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00460k_050	Strange? Well, now that \n you mention it...	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00460k_060	There was glass \n all over the \n warehouse floor \n that morning.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00460k_070	Glass!? \n Did someone break \n in through one \n of the windows?	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00460k_080	Doubtful. Grigos patrol \n the area around the \n warehouse.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00460k_090	And I didn't see any \n signs of an intruder on \n the grounds.	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00460k_100	Oh... I see.	[0, 12, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00460k_110	Hmm... \n Glass on the \n warehouse floor.	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00465k_010	I've got a hunch, \n little lady.	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00465k_020	Don't you think \n something's suspicious \n about the glass?	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00470k_010	Yeah, there was glass on \n the warehouse floor that \n day.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00470k_020	I cleaned it up right \n away...	[0, 29, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00470k_030	Heck, I just figured it \n was someone being \n careless.	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00470k_040	Careless?	[0, 9, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00470k_050	It might be related to \n the case.	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00480k_010	Sure, we have Molotov \n cocktails in the \n warehouse.	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00480k_020	Let's check it out.	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00480k_030	This is one of the \n bottles.	[0, 27, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00480k_040	Looks pretty ordinary.	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00480k_050	They're usually stored \n in crates.	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00480k_060	Hm?	[0, 3, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00480k_070	What is it, boss?	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00480k_080	Nothing... Just feels \n like I've seen that \n bottle before.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00480k_090	Shoot, wish I could \n remember where.	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00485k_010	Sure, we have Molotov \n cocktails in the \n warehouse.	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00485k_020	Let's check it out.	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00485k_030	This is one of \n the bottles.	[0, 27, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00485k_040	Wait...	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00485k_050	What is it, boss?	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00485k_060	I've seen this \n bottle before...	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00485k_070	Oh, right!	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00485k_080	I remember thinking \n it was booze and \n taking a sip!	[0, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00485k_090	Y-You what!?	[0, 12, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00485k_100	I was on my way home \n from the bar, and wanted \n one last nip before \n calling it a night...	[0, 87, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00485k_110	So I dropped by the \n warehouse to see if \n anything would fit \n the bill.	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00485k_120	I thought those bottles \n were filled with \n drinking alcohol.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00485k_130	Boy did I pay for my \n mistake. My stomach was \n wrecked the next day.	[0, 66, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00485k_140	What did you do \n with the bottle?	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00485k_150	Out of shock, \n I tossed it.	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00485k_160	Well, now we know \n where the glass on \n the floor came from.	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00485k_170	Sounds like I'm the one \n to blame for that.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00485k_180	I guess I did have \n a little too much \n to drink...	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00490k_010	Oh, so Captain \n Bulbosa's behind the \n glass on the floor?	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00490k_020	Seems unfair for \n everyone to be coming \n down on me then.	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00490k_030	Sorry about that.	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00490k_040	It's your fault for \n leaving bottles lying \n around on the floor.	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00490k_050	Strange, we usually \n keep the bottles \n packed away in the \n crates.	[0, 63, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00490k_060	What did you expect \n would happen with a \n bottle lying around?	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00490k_070	Probably not that \n someone would pick \n it up off the floor \n and drink it.	[0, 70, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00500k_010	The victim was hit on \n the head with a blunt \n object, then stuffed \n into a crate.	[0, 78, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00500k_020	Did whoever do it \n know the victim \n was a police officer?	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00500k_030	Looks like we need \n to explore the \n criminal's motivations \n a little more.	[0, 71, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00510k_010	...	[0, 3, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00510k_020	Chaz, what's wrong?	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00510k_030	We now know the story \n behind the glass on \n the floor...	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00510k_040	And we know glass \n was found in the \n rookie's clothes...	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00510k_050	So, if the rookie's \n assailant was wielding \n the bottle, that \n means...	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00510k_060	Hey now, you're not \n about to point the \n finger at me, are you?	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00510k_070	The bottle's my fault, \n but there was no one \n else in the warehouse \n when I was there.	[0, 83, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00510k_080	Maybe the criminal \n was trying to pin the \n crime on Bulbosa?	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00510k_090	They could've been \n the one to put the \n glass in the rookie's \n clothes.	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00520k_010	I was working late the \n night of the incident.	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00520k_020	Preparing for the \n training? Chaz, you \n need to take it easy \n on the overtime.	[0, 75, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00520k_030	No, the training \n program was all \n ready.	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00520k_040	I just wanted to \n double-check \n something.	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00520k_050	Had to make sure \n the balance of the \n explosives was \n perfect...	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00520k_060	I knew it! \n Chaz is really \n into explosions.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00530k_010	The victim was one \n of the trainees.	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00530k_020	When he didn't show up \n or call in, I have to \n admit I was worried.	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00530k_030	I'm sure you were \n surprised to find him \n in one of the crates.	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00540k_010	I had no idea my \n training program was \n so hated...	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00540k_020	Don't take it \n too hard.	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00540k_030	Say, little lady, you \n underwent Chaz's \n training, didn't you?	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00540k_040	Yep! Hmm...	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00540k_050	Could this all be \n someone trying to \n interfere with Chaz's \n training program?	[0, 75, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00550k_010	There was a \n missing crate?	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00550k_020	Aww, don't go telling \n Lieutenant Chaz on me!	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00550k_030	Sounds like someone \n needs an extra round \n of attentiveness \n training.	[0, 67, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00550k_040	And I'm guessing \n things will explode \n if he fails...	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00550k_050	Come on, Chaz, save the \n lecture for after we \n solve this case.	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00560k_010	The crates with the \n explosives we use in \n training are stored in \n the warehouse.	[0, 78, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00560k_020	Yeah, I brought them \n out to the training \n site that morning.	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00560k_030	And the rookie was in \n one of them...	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00560k_040	Did you notice anything \n strange when you were \n hauling crates?	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00560k_050	Strange? Well, now that \n you mention it...	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00560k_060	There was glass \n all over the \n warehouse floor \n that morning.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00560k_070	Glass!? \n Did someone break \n in through one \n of the windows?	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00560k_080	Doubtful. Grigos patrol \n the area around the \n warehouse.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

sm50_00560k_100	Oh... I see.	[0, 12, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00560k_110	Hmm... \n Glass on the \n warehouse floor.	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00570k_010	You never reported \n the glass on the \n warehouse floor.	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00570k_020	It could be valuable \n evidence.	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00570k_030	S-Sorry, sir!	[0, 13, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00570k_040	What's done is done...	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00570k_050	Hey! I'm not sure if \n it's relevant to the \n case, but...	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00570k_060	Now that you mention it, \n the doctor said he \n removed glass from my \n clothing.	[0, 75, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00570k_070	Glass in your \n clothing?	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00570k_080	This is a shard he \n found.	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00570k_090	It's tinted, and it's \n curved a bit.	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00570k_100	I doubt it came from a \n window.	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00570k_110	That looks like a piece \n from a Molotov cocktail \n bottle.	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00570k_120	The glass I found on the \n floor looked like that.	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00570k_130	A Molotov cocktail?	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00570k_140	No mistake. I remember \n sweeping up a label \n warning about the \n content.	[0, 69, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00570k_150	Glass all over \n the floor.	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00570k_160	And in the \n rookie's clothes...	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00570k_170	I think we're getting \n close to our answer.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00580k_010	An empty Molotov \n cocktail bottle?	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00580k_020	Well, we do use \n Molotov cocktails \n in training.	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00580k_030	But we always \n leave the bottles \n in the crates.	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00580k_040	So someone went into \n the warehouse and took \n the bottle out?	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00580k_050	But what happened to \n the stuff inside?	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00580k_060	And the bottle was found \n broken on the floor...	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00580k_070	So did someone remove \n the explosive contents, \n then break it?	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00580k_080	It would seem so, \n but that doesn't \n make much sense.	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00580k_090	No, not if the \n criminal was after \n the explosives.	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00580k_100	And why would they go \n breaking the bottle \n and leaving evidence \n like that?	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00580k_110	Sounds like we still \n need more information.	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00590k_010	Guess the broken glass \n doesn't have anything \n to do with the case...	[0, 67, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00590k_020	But why was the bottle \n taken from the crate in \n the first place?	[0, 63, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00590k_030	Hmm... That is \n strange.	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00590k_040	A missing crate, \n an explosive bottle...	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00590k_050	They must be related.	[0, 21, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00595k_010	*Sigh*	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00595k_020	What's wrong?	[0, 13, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00595k_030	We didn't figure out \n what was used to attack \n the rookie.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00595k_040	Or why he was stuffed \n into the crate in the \n first place.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00595k_050	Yeah...	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00595k_060	I think we've reached a \n dead end - there's \n nothing else we can do.	[0, 66, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm50_00595k_070	You're not giving up, \n are you? I'll find that \n criminal, trust me!	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
