ep06_00143	Huh? What's an airboat doing parked here?	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep06_00144	Wait! Is that-?	[0, 15, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep06_00145	I need to check around that island...	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep06_00146	Hm?	[0, 3, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep06_00147	That might be the owner over there. Better go find out.	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep06_00148	Hm?	[0, 3, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

ep06_00150k_090	I grew bored of all the \n other games.	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

ep06_00167k_020	I uh, heard fuel was \n hard to come by down \n here... 	[0, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

ep06_00170k_030	Only the people up in \n Lei Havina have the kind \n of cash to buy this \n much.	[0, 72, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep06_00170k_040	I got it while helping \n out a woman up there.	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep06_00170k_050	She can consider it a \n down payment on my \n services...	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep06_00170k_060	Thanks! You don't know \n how much this means to \n us. I'll see it gets to \n the people.	[0, 81, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep06_00175k_010	I'm so bored... Isn't \n there anything new and \n exciting to do?	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
