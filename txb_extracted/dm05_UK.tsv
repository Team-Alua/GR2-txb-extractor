dm05_00110k_030	All of the factors \n aren't in place. There's \n a synchronisation issue.	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_00110k_040	Synchronisation? \n What does that mean?	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

dm05_00150k_010	You really think you \n can defeat me?	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_00150k_020	You just don't have it \n in you to take my \n power from me.	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_00150k_030	What does she mean!?	[0, 20, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_00150k_040	You don't yet have \n the power you need \n to finish her off. \n She'll be back again.	[0, 78, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_00155k_010	Did you think \n you defeated me?	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

dm05_00170k_030	How!?	[0, 5, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_00170k_040	Your memories are \n somehow connected \n to the elements of \n Light and Darkness.	[0, 74, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_00170k_050	And taking them out \n might help me find \n what I'm missing.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_00210k_010	I remember now...	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_00210k_020	And now you have the \n power you need to claim \n the elements of Light \n and Darkness.	[0, 80, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_00210k_030	Creator! You won't \n get away with this.	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_00210k_040	The world can't exist \n without light and \n darkness. We won't be \n so easy to control.	[0, 81, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_00210k_050	The great and powerful \n Creator, throwing in \n with humans, really...	[0, 66, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_00210k_060	I'm disappointed in you.	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_00210k_070	I haven't interfered, \n I've only guided.	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

dm05_01010	Bit: \n Stop them from powering each other up.	[0, 5, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [5, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_01011	No, I let them power up!	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_01012	This is going to make things tricky.	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_01013	Great, now they're more powerful than ever.	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_01014	That stopped them.	[0, 18, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_01015	Oh no, you're not powering up on me.	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_01016	That put a stop to them.	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_01017	Bit: \n They're back to normal. Now's your chance to fight back.	[0, 5, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [5, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_01018	Bit: \n I think they've run out of power, for now.	[0, 5, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [5, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_01019	Bit: \n They've lost their power, you need to go on the attack.	[0, 5, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [5, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_01030	What's this light...?	[0, 21, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_01031	Bit: \n That light will guide you to your lost memories.	[0, 5, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [5, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_01032	The light's leading to one of my memories.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_01033	Now's my chance to find another memory.	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_01034	The light should lead me where I need to go.	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_01035	Bit: \n I don't sense any memories here. Try somewhere else.	[0, 5, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [5, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm05_01036	Bit: \n There don't seem to be any memories around here.	[0, 5, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [5, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
