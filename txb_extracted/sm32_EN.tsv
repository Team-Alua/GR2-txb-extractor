sm32_00100k_010	...	[0, 3, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00100k_020	What's up, Chaz? \n Something bothering you?	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00100k_030	Well, I'm in charge of \n training all the new \n recruits...	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00100k_040	But there's one trainee \n who hasn't shown up - he \n hasn't even checked in.	[0, 72, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00100k_050	Maybe he just overslept?	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00100k_060	Say, Kat, would you mind \n undertaking the training \n instead?	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00100k_070	Why me?	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00100k_080	I want someone who \n can give me objective \n feedback on my \n training program.	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00100k_090	Though I'm sure it'll \n be far too basic for \n someone like you...	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00100k_100	Hmm... Training does \n sound kind of boring...	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00100k_110	Tell you what, do me \n this favor, and I'll \n treat you to dinner.	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00100k_120	Okay, you hooked me! \n And hey, it's my civic \n responsibility to help \n the police, right?	[0, 85, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00100k_130	Thank you. \n Okay, let's head over \n to the training site.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00101k_010	Let's begin \n the training.	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00101k_020	Please don't use your \n gravity powers so we can \n simulate the experience \n of a normal recruit.	[0, 91, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00101k_030	Yeah, no problem!	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00101k_040	Just "yes" will do. Now \n that you're a recruit, \n you have to act like \n one.	[0, 72, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00101k_050	He's taking this a \n little seriously...	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00101k_060	First is training your \n "photographic memory."	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00101k_070	This is important for \n building concentration \n and memory skills.	[0, 63, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00101k_080	But before we start, \n break that box.	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00101k_090	Huh? \n You want me to \n break a box?	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00102	Remember the Contents \n of the Picture	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00102k_010	I-It exploded!	[0, 14, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00102k_020	It's rigged to explode \n if you make a mistake.	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00102k_030	In a real investigation, \n mistakes can be \n the difference between \n life and death.	[0, 79, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00102k_040	I need recruits to \n understand that, not \n just with their mind, \n but with their body.	[0, 82, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00102k_050	But that's dangerous!	[0, 21, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00102k_060	I've ensured the \n gunpowder isn't enough \n to kill anyone.	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00102k_070	And if you want to avoid \n the pain, all you have \n to do is answer \n correctly.	[0, 74, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00102k_080	This training program \n is a little extreme...	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

sm32_00103k_020	I'll hand you a picture. \n Try to remember \n everything about it.	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00103k_030	When you're ready, let \n me know, and I'll ask \n you a few questions.	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00103k_040	If you can answer three \n in a row, you pass the \n test.	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00104	Chaz: \n We're in the middle of training, you can't leave now.	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [6, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

sm32_00111k_010	Wrong.	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00111k_020	Pay attention to the \n order of the people in \n the picture.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00111k_030	Let's try again.	[0, 16, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00112k_010	Here's the first \n question.	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00112k_020	Who was on the \n rightmost side of \n the picture?	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

sm32_00131k_020	Pay attention to what \n the people are doing.	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00131k_030	Let's try again.	[0, 16, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00132k_010	And now the third and \n final question.	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00132k_020	Who was sitting in the \n picture?	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

sm32_00200k_020	Awesome, I passed!	[0, 18, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00200k_030	Alright, let's move on \n to the next training \n challenge.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00200k_040	Chaz, don't be in such a \n rush, where's my praise \n for doing a good job?	[0, 70, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00200k_050	Training is part of the \n job. Passing the test \n is a requirement.	[0, 63, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00200k_060	Motivation should \n be an important \n part of the job too...	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00201k_010	Next up...	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00201k_020	We need to train your \n "situational awareness" \n to help with controlling \n criminals.	[0, 81, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00201k_030	A little fighting, eh? \n I should ace this part!	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00201k_040	My fellow officers will \n be playing the part of \n some criminals you need \n to knock out.	[0, 84, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00201k_050	But before that, \n I need you to \n break that box.	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00201k_060	Uh-oh... \n Another box?	[0, 21, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00201k_070	Yes, please.	[0, 12, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00202k_010	I knew it!	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00202k_020	More boxes like that \n one will be scattered \n across the field.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00202k_030	You're to assume \n they're citizens. \n Avoid collateral \n damage.	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00202k_040	Fine, but why do \n the citizens have \n to explode!?	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00202k_050	It's a police officer's \n first duty to protect \n citizens. It's important \n to remember that.	[0, 88, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00202k_060	Not just with the mind, \n but with the body.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00202k_070	Chaz is going a little \n overboard. I feel bad \n for his trainees.	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00210k_010	Let's begin the \n situational awareness \n training.	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00210k_020	Take out the bad guys \n without hurting the \n civilian boxes.	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00210k_030	If you destroy three or \n more boxes...	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00210k_040	Or if you leave the \n fighting area, you fail.	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00211k_010	You failed. Let's try \n that again.	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00211k_020	Please be more \n careful around the \n citizens this time.	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00212k_010	You failed to stay \n within the \n fighting area.	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00220k_010	I did it! They're all \n knocked out cold!	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00220k_020	Consider that a \n practice round.	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00220k_030	The next fight is \n the real deal.	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00220k_040	Okay...	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00221k_010	You broke the boxes, \n try it again.	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00221k_020	Agh! Those boxes just \n keep getting in the way.	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00221k_030	Those "boxes" are the \n civilians you're \n supposed to protect.	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00222k_010	You left the designated \n area, try it again.	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00222k_020	There aren't any \n "designated areas" \n in a real fight...	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00230k_010	There, that's all of \n 'em. Am I done now?	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00230k_020	No, the next fight is \n the real deal.	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00230k_030	Wait!? You just said \n that about the last \n fight!	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00230k_040	An officer must be ready \n to be pushed to the \n limit and then pushed \n some more.	[0, 77, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00230k_050	That's how we grow.	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00230k_060	It's just like \n weight training.	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00230k_070	In other words, \n painful...	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00231k_010	You broke the boxes, \n try it again.	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00231k_020	Is it really \n necessary for the \n citizens to explode?	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00231k_030	Yes, that's how the \n training exercise was \n designed, so we do it \n by the book.	[0, 76, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00232k_010	You left the designated \n area, try it again.	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00232k_020	Isn't taking down the \n bad guys the only thing \n that's important?	[0, 63, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00300k_010	You've passed with \n flying colors, Kat.	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00300k_020	I-I did?	[0, 8, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00300k_030	Finally, some praise \n after all this time!	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00300k_040	Okay, let's move to \n the site for the \n next lesson.	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00301k_010	We're here to train your \n "character judgment" \n skills.	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00301k_020	The goal is to train \n your attentiveness and \n assessment skills to \n aid in crime prevention.	[0, 89, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00301k_030	That's fine, but I'm not \n breaking any more boxes.	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00302k_010	How many times do I have \n to tell you, enough with \n the explosions!	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00302k_020	If you fail to spot the \n suspect, the box will \n explode as it did just \n now.	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00302k_030	As an officer, if you \n don't stop crime before \n it starts, an innocent \n citizen gets hurt.	[0, 87, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00302k_040	Officers have to \n understand that, not \n just with their minds, \n but with their bodies.	[0, 83, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00302k_050	I'm starting to think \n Chaz just likes \n explosions...	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00310k_010	Let's begin the \n character judgment \n training.	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00310k_020	Police officers playing \n suspicious people are \n coming this way.	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00310k_030	Stand on that box and \n capture them with your \n camera before it's too \n late.	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00310k_040	If you can get a clear \n picture of their face, \n you're fine.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00310k_050	But if the suspect gets \n close to you, you fail.	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00311k_010	You failed. \n Let's try that again.	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00311k_020	Stay calm, and watch the \n suspect's movements.	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00320k_010	I got the picture! \n That was pretty \n straightforward.	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00320k_020	That's because it was \n practice, and there was \n only one criminal.	[0, 64, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00320k_030	Oh...	[0, 5, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00320k_040	Next, there'll be two. \n Get both of their \n pictures.	[0, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00321k_010	You failed. \n Let's try that again.	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00321k_020	Pay close attention and \n make sure you grab both \n of them on film.	[0, 64, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00330k_010	You passed.	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00330k_020	Not bad, huh?	[0, 13, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00330k_030	Next, there \n will be four.	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00330k_040	What!? Now they're \n growing exponentially?	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00330k_050	Don't let any of them \n slip through. Capture \n them all on film.	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00331k_010	You failed. \n Let's try that again.	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00331k_020	Be aware of your \n surroundings, and don't \n let them slip by.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00350k_005	Why are you taking \n a picture of me?	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00350k_010	We're in the middle of \n training, please take it \n seriously.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00350k_020	Seriously, got it...	[0, 20, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00400k_010	You pass. You got all of \n their pictures.	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00400k_020	Hehe. Does this mean \n I've passed all your \n tests?	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00400k_030	The training must be too \n easy. I need to step it \n up to unlock an \n officer's potential.	[0, 85, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00400k_040	Wha-!?	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00400k_050	Oh, nothing. Your \n training's not done-	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00401k_010	I'm done with this! \n No more training, \n no more explosions!	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00401k_020	I think I've been nice \n until now, but it's time \n I spoke my mind.	[0, 64, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00401k_030	You're too obsessed with \n all this and too hard on \n your trainees.	[0, 64, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00401k_040	That trainee who didn't \n show up had the right \n idea if he values his \n life!	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00401k_050	And what's with that \n training box shaking \n right there... Another \n explosion?	[0, 75, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00401k_060	I didn't rig it with \n explosives...	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00401k_070	If it wasn't you, \n then...	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00402k_010	Ugh...	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00402k_020	There was a person \n inside!	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00402k_030	You're that trainee \n who didn't show up!	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00402k_040	Are you okay? \n What happened?	[0, 28, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00402k_050	Ugh...	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00402k_060	Training's over. Kat, \n get this man to a \n hospital, quick.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00402k_070	The person we found in the box was the \n police rookie I was standing in for.	[0, 75, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_00402k_080	He was admitted to the hospital with serious injuries, \n but we still have no idea how he ended up in the box. \n And in all the excitement, Chaz forgot to treat me to dinner.	[0, 170, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm32_01001	Broken Boxes	[0, 12, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
