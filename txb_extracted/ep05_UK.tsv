ep05_00110k_050	Fi, what's past is past. \n There's no use wasting \n time thinking about it.	[0, 71, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep05_00110k_060	Better to think of a way \n to get that cargo back, \n right?	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep05_00110k_070	Right! You're right!	[0, 20, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep05_00110k_080	Vogo sure seems eager \n to move on past his \n mistake...	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep05_00110k_090	How do we get it back?	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep05_00110k_100	We could start by asking \n about any suspicious \n characters wearing \n Centipede clothing.	[0, 84, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

ep05_00113k_050	Today's the shipping \n deadline, if we don't \n give the Council their \n cargo...	[0, 74, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep05_00113k_060	They'll revoke Sun \n Shipping's licence and \n we'll be to blame.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

ep05_00115k_030	Wish I did, they've cost \n me a fortune.	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep05_00115k_040	Since then, I've been \n struggling to work off \n the debt I incurred.	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep05_00115k_050	 I used to have money to \n go out on the town, now \n look at me...	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

ep05_00121k_040	Oh yeah, there's a rash \n of it over at the \n market.	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep05_00121k_050	Probably because the \n Council raised taxes \n again.	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep05_00121k_060	But of course, being \n poor is no excuse for \n thieving, no excuse at \n all.	[0, 70, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep05_00121k_070	You've got that right!	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep05_00122k_010	You're lookin' for these \n guys?	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep05_00122k_020	Did they steal \n somethin' again?	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
