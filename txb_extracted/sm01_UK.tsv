053c14a2	And I need to find a way \n to get back to \n Hekseville.	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
0de01a8b	I don't dislike, I mean \n I don't hate, I mean-	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
1e603101	Oh? \n Oh... Okay. \n Thanks Misai!	[0, 29, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
26e30298	I still can't get over \n that you're able to go \n toe-to-toe with those \n things. Impressive.	[0, 87, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
27a83307	Cecie! I'll treat you to \n something too if you \n just leave it at that.	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
2f0e5309	Okay, I'll just leave \n the report here. Could \n you give it to her when \n she gets back?	[0, 83, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
36bf1df1	What I was trying to say \n earlier was, uh-	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
3f0720f7	O-Oh, could you hold on \n a sec? I had something \n to tell you...	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
50b541ff	S-Sure, you just relax \n and unwind after all \n that work.	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
52676933	You sounded like you had \n something else to say \n when we were talking...	[0, 70, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
59fd4305	Say, uh, Kat. Thanks for \n your help today.	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
5baf6b39	Oh, uh, like I said, \n it's nothing.	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
5c2e7e8c	Thanks!	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
60ae0eed	I'm sorry, was I being a \n third wheel before? You \n were going to ask Kat-	[0, 71, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
6245460b	I wish there was a way \n to thank you. How about \n I buy you a meal?	[0, 64, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
65768092	Misai, stay back. I'll \n mop 'em up for you.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
69f610f3	Huh!?	[0, 5, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
6b8d4811	That sounds great! \n I could use some food.	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
6ebe8298	Where did all these \n Scarabs come from?	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
723e13f9	Uh, Misai? Kat already \n left to get cleaned up.	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
7485feab	I'm sorry, Misai, I \n should've come faster.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
7c0d5f87	It's a deal then.	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
8555618d	Guess I'd better wash up \n first. I worked up a \n sweat out there.	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
a6fc4f83	Welcome back, Kat! \n Lisa's out right now.	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
aff4051e	It was my fault. I \n wasn't thinking.	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
c00d64a7	Let's clean up here and \n go home!	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
d09bf413	Going back to what we \n were talking about \n earlier...	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
d9e3f619	Thanks!	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
e22bf91f	I still need to find the \n friend I was separated \n from...	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
eb73fb25	I think someday I'll \n have to leave Banga.	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
fb4f167f	Anytime you want to go \n out-uh, mining I mean. \n Just let me know.	[0, 63, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
fcf3119c	Yeah, I kinda figured...	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
fde64d9d	I'm all done surveying \n the mining site! Hm?	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00100k_010	Hey, Kat, wanna help me \n survey a mining site?	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00100k_020	It'll, uh, just be \n the two of us.	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00100k_030	Sure, but what are \n you surveying?	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00100k_040	We need data to figure \n out how much ore we \n can expect before we \n begin mining.	[0, 77, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00100k_050	Given the Scarab \n problem, I usually head \n out with a group for \n safety.	[0, 69, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00100k_060	But with you and your \n power, I think we could \n handle it ourselves.	[0, 66, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00100k_070	Gotcha! That sounds \n more efficient too. \n Let's do it.	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00100k_080	Y-You're cool with that? \n O-Okay, let's head out \n then.	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00150k_010	So, how do we survey the \n ore deposits?	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00150k_020	It's pretty much like \n minin', but we go around \n the sites and check the \n ore composition.	[0, 87, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00150k_030	First things first, take \n me over to an island \n with some ore.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00200k_010	Scarabs!	[0, 8, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00200k_020	Can you whittle their \n numbers  down for us?	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00200k_030	Then drop me off \n by an ore deposit.	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00200k_040	Just don't leave me in \n the middle of a bunch \n of Scarabs, okay?	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00200k_050	Don't worry! \n Even if I set you down, \n I'll come back for you.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00200k_060	Make sure you do!	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00300k_010	Phew, that was \n an adrenaline rush.	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00300k_020	I've gotta admit, \n you make it easy to \n get around even with \n the Scarabs.	[0, 71, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00300k_030	This Gravity Shifter is \n at your service!	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00300k_040	I need to take some \n composition samples. \n Help a guy out?	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00300k_050	Sure! I just need to \n mine the ore for \n you, right?	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00330k_010	All done!	[0, 9, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00330k_020	That was quick! Okay, \n next is that island over \n there.	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00330k_030	Hate to ask, but should \n we be using up so much \n ore just for a survey?	[0, 69, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00330k_040	Hm? Oh, it's fine. The \n ore will grow back by \n the time we come around \n again.	[0, 75, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00330k_050	Oh, wow, I didn't know \n it did that! You sure \n know your stuff.	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00330k_060	I better, I've been at \n it for as long as I can \n remember.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00330k_070	Alright, let's move to \n the next island.	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00330k_080	Got it! Next island, \n coming right up.	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00360k_010	Hey! There's nothing \n left for me to mine.	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00360k_020	Looks like I win the \n competition this time!	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00360k_030	We're not out here for \n fun, you know. Come on, \n let's go to the next \n island.	[0, 75, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00400k_010	You've already got the \n samples? Nice job.	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00400k_020	Yeah, though I had to \n take a few Scarabs down \n to get 'em.	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00400k_030	I think we're good here, \n let's move to the next \n island.	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00500k_010	Hmm, strange, there \n aren't any Scarabs \n around.	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00500k_020	Don't jinx it. Would be \n nice to mine in peace \n for a change.	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00500k_030	Good point...	[0, 13, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00500k_040	If you don't mind me \n askin', how long are you \n planning on staying in \n Banga?	[0, 75, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00500k_050	What? You want me to \n leave or something?	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00500k_060	N-No! That's not what I-	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00500k_070	Banga really needs \n someone like you around.	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00500k_080	And I... \n You see...	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00500k_090	Hm?	[0, 3, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00500k_100	Oh, uh, \n never mind, \n it's nothing.	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00500k_110	Aww, come on, tell me. \n It'll drive me nuts if \n you don't.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00500k_120	We don't have time for \n chatting, get to the \n next island and start \n mining!	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00500k_130	That island way over \n there? You gonna be okay \n if I leave you here?	[0, 66, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00500k_140	I'm fine! You were \n screwin' up my readings \n anyway...	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm01_00500k_150	I was?	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
