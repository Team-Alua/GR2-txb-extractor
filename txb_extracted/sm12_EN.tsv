sm12_00123	Time to have a look around the hideout.	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm12_00124	I don't think this is the right way to go.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm12_00200k_010	There must be a hint to \n finding the guy in this \n plot synopsis...	[0, 64, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm12_00200k_020	"There was a man, a very \n ordinary man, with a \n very ordinary life. And \n he was bored."	[0, 84, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

sm12_00200k_110	If the author is \n becoming his characters, \n he must be wearing a \n bandit costume.	[0, 78, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm12_00200k_120	I wonder if he's posing \n as an Angry Centipede \n member?	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm12_00200k_130	I should check over \n by their hideout.	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
