sm14_00100k_020	Raven?	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00100k_030	She hasn't been out to \n the mines yet, right?	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00100k_040	You know the rules: \n A lazy worker is \n a hungry worker.	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00100k_050	And Raven's a very \n hungry worker. She'll \n wipe out your food \n supplies.	[0, 69, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00100k_060	Did someone say food?	[0, 21, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00100k_070	Speak of the appetite!	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00100k_080	Hey, you wanna go \n out on a mining trip \n with us?	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00100k_090	You've never done it \n before, right? Come on, \n I'll show you the ropes.	[0, 69, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00100k_100	Mining... Sure, \n I'll give it a try.	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00100k_110	Sounds like a plan! \n Let's head out.	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00200k_010	*Beep* *Beep*	[0, 13, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00200k_020	Hey, you only need to \n mine one person's worth \n of ore, got it?	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00200k_030	There's only two of you \n and she's new to mining, \n so don't go overboard.	[0, 71, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00200k_040	Alright! Guess I'd \n better explain how this \n all works.	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00200k_050	Raven, we have to find \n the ore deposits and \n break 'em to extract the \n ore.	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00200k_060	Grab the ore and you're \n done. That's all there \n is to it!	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00200k_070	Got it.	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00200k_080	You're new at this, so \n collecting, say, 20 \n should be enough.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00200k_090	Might as well grab \n about 40 myself \n while we're out here.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00200k_100	If I pull in double \n what Raven does, \n I'm sure she'll be \n impressed.	[0, 66, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00200k_110	Okay, let's get started!	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00400k_010	Raven! Not bad for a \n first haul.	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00400k_020	I think I've got the \n hang of it.	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00400k_030	I couldn't bother \n keeping count, so I \n don't know how \n much I brought in.	[0, 71, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00400k_040	Huh?	[0, 4, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00400k_050	W-Wait, look at \n all that ore!	[0, 29, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00400k_060	That's more \n than I mined!	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00400k_070	Say, Raven, how about a \n little competition this \n time?	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00400k_080	What, that wasn't \n enough ore?	[0, 29, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00400k_090	E-Exactly! This is \n hardly enough.	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00400k_100	And a little competition \n should help motivate us.	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00400k_110	You have a point.	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00400k_120	Of course, but \n don't strain yourself.	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00400k_130	Taking it slow is \n important for extracting \n high-quality ore.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00400k_140	I see. Mining is much \n deeper than I expected.	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00400k_150	I know, right? Okay, \n let's head over to the \n next island.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00430k_010	Alright, let's mine \n around here.	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00430k_020	Hmm... The landscape \n seems a little more \n complicated than the \n last island.	[0, 74, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00430k_030	I better get 50 this \n time to make sure I \n don't lose.	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00430k_040	Here we go!	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00440k_010	What are you doing?	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00440k_020	Huh? \n Oh, sorry!	[0, 15, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00440k_030	I need to focus!	[0, 16, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00450k_010	Look at all this \n ore! I must've \n won for sure.	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00450k_020	Raven, how'd you do?	[0, 20, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00450k_030	Not bad.	[0, 8, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00450k_040	Wh-What!? I lost again! \n How'd you mine so much!?	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00450k_050	It was like you said, \n taking it slow helped \n me extract higher \n quality ore.	[0, 74, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00450k_060	How did you do?	[0, 15, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00450k_070	Okay, that's enough \n practice. Let's move on \n to the real deal.	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00450k_080	That was just \n a practice run?	[0, 29, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00450k_090	Of course, but let's \n head over to the next \n island for the real \n competition.	[0, 75, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00450k_200	I have to win \n next time...	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00470k_010	I'll get 60 this time! \n There's no way Raven \n could beat that.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00470k_020	Okay, we're here. \n I hope this isn't \n another practice run?	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00470k_030	Nope, this time's \n for real!	[0, 27, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00500k_010	Phew, how'd you do?	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00500k_020	Not so hot.	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00500k_030	O-Oh, I see. Don't let \n it get you down, you're \n still green at this.	[0, 67, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00500k_040	Let's count your share. \n 1, 2, 3...	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00500k_050	I-I lost by one! \n What did she mean \n by "not so hot"?	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00500k_060	I thought I could do \n better. I should've \n tried taking it easier.	[0, 64, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00500k_070	Here's a thought, \n couldn't we speed up the \n mining process with a \n special move?	[0, 78, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00500k_080	It'll tire us out, but \n save a lot of time. \n Seems like it could be \n more efficient.	[0, 81, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00500k_090	I think the student has \n become the master.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00500k_100	You look disappointed.	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00500k_110	Well, it's just I have \n been at this longer.	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00500k_120	And even so, you mined \n more than me.	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00500k_130	I still don't understand \n why that would get you \n down.	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00500k_140	You really don't get it, \n do you?	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00500k_150	Hm? What's that?	[0, 16, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_00500k_160	Don't change the \n conversation!	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_01000	I should head back to that mining site.	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_01001	Head to the Mining Site \n with Raven	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_01002	I need to get back to mining.	[0, 29, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_01003	That should do it.	[0, 18, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_01004	I need to head to the next island.	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_01005	Head to the Next \n Mining Site	[0, 28, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_01006	A little competition should do me good.	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_01007	I'm sure Raven just got lucky.	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_02000	Ready, set, go!	[0, 15, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_02001	Mine More than Raven	[0, 20, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_02002	That should be enough to win it for me!	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_02003	I need to get my head in the game...	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_02004	Dig down, dig deep. Dig down, dig deep!	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_02005	Ready for round three? Let's go!	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_02006	This time I have to beat Raven!	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_02007	I'm sure I beat Raven this time...	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03000	Defeat More Scarabs \n Than Raven	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03001	Time to take out those Scarabs!	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03002	Raven: \n I thought you were going to show me how it's done.	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [7, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03003	Got the first one!	[0, 18, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03004	That's the second one!	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03005	I'll take out the rest too.	[0, 27, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03006	Not bad.	[0, 8, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03007	Who's next?	[0, 11, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03008	I can't lose this one.	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03009	Have to make the last one count.	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03010	Good one, Raven!	[0, 16, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03011	Shoot, she's gonna win.	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03012	Raven: \n Hmph, at this rate, you know I'm going to win.	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [7, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03013	Raven: \n This beats mining.	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [7, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03014	Raven: \n I'll take the others out too!	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [7, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03015	That's the last of 'em!	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03016	Return to the Mining Cage	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03017	We've got more than enough, let's head home.	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03018	Three to go!	[0, 12, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03019	Last one!	[0, 9, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_03020	Now it's just these guys.	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09000	This is how you do it!	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09001	Here's how you mine gravity ore.	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09002	Okay, pay attention to how I'm doing this.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09003	There, that's how it's done!	[0, 28, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09004	I can do better than last time.	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09005	I need to show what I can do.	[0, 29, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09006	It's time to show Raven what mining's all about!	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09007	I have to prove I'm good at this.	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09008	Okay, it's time to speed things up!	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09009	Let's do this!	[0, 14, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09010	There's no way Raven can keep up with me now.	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09011	Phew, mining's hard work! But I can't stop now.	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09012	That's it, Raven.	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09013	It's all about hitting it from the right angle.	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09014	There you go, that's the way to do it.	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09015	Keep it up, Raven!	[0, 18, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09016	Raven's on fire!	[0, 16, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

sm14_09018	Oh wow, that was a good kick...	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09019	Raven's got good form, I'll give her that.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09020	Y-You sure this is the first time you've been mining?	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09021	I need to mine more...	[0, 22, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09022	Maybe I'm off my game today.	[0, 28, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09023	Raven's going to win at this rate...	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm14_09024	Gems Required	[0, 13, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
