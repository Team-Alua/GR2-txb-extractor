dm03_00116	Kat's frozen like all the others.	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

dm03_00123	Kat was leading people to safety when the explosion went off.	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00124	Is the explosion on the Ark behind time stopping?	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

dm03_00132	What happened to Hekseville?	[0, 28, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00133	The explosion with the Ark... Was that my fault?	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00134	Where'd Dusty go now?	[0, 21, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00135	Dusty, where are you going!?	[0, 28, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00136	How can I get this place back to normal?	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00137	I'd better find Kat. Together we can figure this out.	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00138	Kat!?	[0, 5, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00139	Not you too...	[0, 14, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00140	How'd this happen?	[0, 18, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00141	Wait! Now how am I supposed to find them?	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00142	Bit: \n The answers you seek are with the Nevi...	[0, 5, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [5, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00143	I heard something from over there.	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00144	A cat!	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00145	That way?	[0, 9, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00146	I need to follow Dusty.	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00147	I have to find Dusty...	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00148	I have to find Kat.	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00149	I need to find Kat.	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00150	Dusty!	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00151	Dusty, there you are!	[0, 21, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00152	There you are, Dusty!	[0, 21, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00160	They seem to vanish when I get near them.	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00161	At least it doesn't look like I can harm them.	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00200m_010	What happened?	[0, 14, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_010	Raven, I'm afraid this \n world system's bug is \n more serious than I \n thought.	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_020	I should mention that \n this isn't my true form.	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_030	I just use it when I \n need to reveal myself to \n people.	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_040	Though, I suppose no one \n is going to notice.	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_050	Why aren't they moving!? \n What happened to \n Hekseville?	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_060	A bit of system trouble \n caused the world's clock \n to stop.	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_070	I did what you told me! \n Why didn't it fix \n things?	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_080	Blame me if you like, \n but this is out of my \n control.	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_090	There are just too many \n variables involved.	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_100	One bug leads to \n another.	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_110	The final result? \n System freeze.	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_120	The one thing I do know \n is that any direct \n interference on my part \n will make things worse.	[0, 90, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_130	How convenient! Fine, \n tell me what I need to \n do to fix this.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_140	We were so close to \n waking them. I need \n to get time moving \n again!	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_150	Unfortunately, the world \n couldn't process the \n explosive results of \n the experiment.	[0, 82, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_160	The elements of light \n and darkness that \n power the Ark escaped \n during the event.	[0, 79, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_163	It was almost as if \n they had a mind of \n their own...	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_165	Of course, that would \n be ridiculous... \n Although-	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_168	Just tell me what \n I need to do!	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_170	Oh, right. Bring \n back the Light \n and Darkness.	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_180	They fled into two \n powerful Keepers. \n Find them.	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_190	The Nevi are closely \n tied to light and \n darkness. They will be \n your guide.	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00210k_200	What, am I supposed to \n walk up to a Nevi and \n ask where the Light and \n Darkness ran off to?	[0, 89, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00220k_010	Cyanea! You can move?	[0, 21, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00220k_020	The girl known as Cyanea \n is asleep, like the \n others.	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00220k_030	I guard her dream - the \n dream that makes this \n world.	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00220k_040	As long as she sleeps, \n there is a chance that \n she might repair the \n dream.	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00220k_050	Why does it always take \n so long to get an answer \n out of you Creator \n types?	[0, 74, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00220k_060	I need the element of \n Darkness you're guarding \n to fix the world.	[0, 64, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00220k_070	A boy - one of your kind \n told me that.	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00220k_080	A boy... \n Ah, you mean Bit.	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00220k_090	The Darkness, you say. \n Come to think of it, \n something does feel \n strange inside Cyanea.	[0, 86, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00220k_093	When the Ark exploded, \n I noticed a presence \n entering her dream.	[0, 63, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00220k_096	Let me show you \n the way.	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00220k_100	Raven, look deep \n into my eyes-	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00225k_010	Dreamer, not yet. \n We need more than \n the power of Darkness \n to fix the Ark and time.	[0, 82, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00225k_020	The light complements \n the dark.	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00225k_030	If the power of \n Darkness entered you...	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00225k_040	Then the element \n of Light must have \n entered Gade.	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00225k_050	You must find him. \n Only with both him \n and Cyanea can we \n continue.	[0, 65, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00230k_010	Ah Raven, it's good \n to see you back to \n your old self.	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00230k_013	You were a cute kid, but \n the past is the past.	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00230k_016	I wanted to \n help you...	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00230k_020	But something \n happened to me \n after the Ark \n exploded.	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00230k_030	Must be one of those \n "bugs" the kid keeps \n going on about.	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00230k_040	Makes it tough \n for me to hold \n the world together.	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00235k_010	Ah, there you are.	[0, 18, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00235k_020	No explanations \n this time, just tell me \n what I need to do.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00235k_030	If only we could \n intervene directly, this \n would be so much easier.	[0, 66, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00235k_040	Unfortunate, yes, but \n that's the way it goes. \n We need your help, \n Raven.	[0, 71, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00235k_050	It has to be you. You \n are part of the problem, \n but that's why you can \n also be the solution.	[0, 91, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00235k_060	I thought I said no \n explanations!	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00235k_070	Then let's get to work. \n Raven, we're going to \n need Gade and \n Cyanea's help.	[0, 74, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00235k_080	Wait, what happened to \n the elements of Light \n and Darkness I was \n supposed to recover?	[0, 84, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00235k_090	You'll figure it out. \n "No explanations," \n right?	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00235k_100	Right...	[0, 8, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00300c_010	My eyes once served as a \n conduit for Kat to \n reach the secret world \n of Cyanea's dreams.	[0, 86, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00300c_020	Look into my eyes...	[0, 20, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00300c_030	Are you ready?	[0, 14, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00300c_040	I'll be taking \n you both together.	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00300c_050	...	[0, 3, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00300c_060	To the plane where \n light and dark reside!	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00300c_070	Hmm...	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_00300c_080	All we can do \n now is hope.	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_01000	Nevi!?	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_01001	Find the Keeper \n of Darkness	[0, 27, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_01002	They're not stopped like everything else...	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_01003	The Nevi hold the answer... What does that mean?	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_01006	It's Cyanea!	[0, 12, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_01007	A light! I need to follow it.	[0, 29, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_01008	The light's gone. Do I need to take down more Nevi?	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_01009	I have to find the Keeper of Darkness...	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_01010	Wait, Raven.	[0, 12, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_01020	The light's flowing towards Auldnoir.	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_01021	The light's flowing that way.	[0, 29, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_01022	I think the light's flowing to Pleajeune.	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_02000	I'm not sure how he's involved, but I need to find Gade.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_02001	Find the Keeper \n of Light	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_02004	Defeating Nevi should help me track down the Keeper of Light.	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_02006	That's Gade!	[0, 12, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_02007	Bit: \n Now we're all together.	[0, 5, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [5, 28, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm03_02008	I have to find the Keeper of Light...	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
