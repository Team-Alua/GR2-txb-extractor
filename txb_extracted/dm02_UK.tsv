dm02_00305k_010	Our bus fell. \n All the way down \n to the bottom of \n the world.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00305k_020	I was scared, \n but Zaza was \n there for me.	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00305k_023	That's right. \n Your bus fell to \n the bottom of \n the World Pillar.	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00305k_025	You found the \n village left \n behind by people \n in the past.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

dm02_00310k_140	I'll be fine, Zaza!	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00320k_010	What's this thing? Did \n it fall down here with \n the other stuff?	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00320k_020	Hey, it's making \n weird noises.	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00320k_030	Maybe it's \n someone's airboat?	[0, 29, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00320k_040	If it's still working, \n it can get us back home!	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00320k_050	I've gotta tell Zaza!	[0, 21, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00320k_060	Hmm, I wonder \n if I can fly it back?	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00400m_010	That strange, ancient machine brought \n the young me back to Hekseville.	[0, 70, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00400m_020	But it was no longer the Hekseville I knew. \n And I was alone.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00400m_030	Hekseville had moved on without us.	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00400m_040	Half a century passed since our accident.	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00400m_050	Living alone wasn't easy. \n I was scared, until...	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00400m_060	Xii...	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_010	Welcome back, Raven.	[0, 20, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_020	You...	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_030	Poor Sachya was so \n alone when she \n returned to Hekseville.	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_032	You discovered time \n flowed differently at \n the bottom of the \n world.	[0, 66, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_034	A few months had \n passed down below, but \n half a century passed \n in Hekseville.	[0, 76, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_036	Zaza's parents \n were gone.	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_038	And you were left \n all alone to fend for \n yourself.	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_040	But then you met Xii and \n became the powerful \n Gravity Shifter, Raven.	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_050	You worked so hard to \n save the children you \n left behind.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_060	You tried everything you \n could, but nothing \n worked.	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_070	That is, until you \n worked with the other \n Shifter to get the \n children into the Ark.	[0, 82, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_080	The Ark was only trying \n to keep them safe when \n it put them to sleep.	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_090	And here you are again, \n doing whatever it takes \n to save them.	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_100	How do you know \n so much about me?	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_110	I know more about the \n girl named Sachya and \n the woman named Raven \n than you realise.	[0, 83, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_120	You're one of them, \n aren't you? \n Like Gade and Cyanea.	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_130	I do what I can to keep \n this world's system free \n from bugs.	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_140	You could say I'm an \n engineer of sorts.	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_150	Raven, to fix the \n present, you're going to \n have to fix the past.	[0, 64, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_160	Just like then, you need \n to get the children on \n the Ark and take them \n back to Hekseville.	[0, 89, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00405k_170	They're waiting for \n you to lead them.	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00410k_003	That's the Zaza \n I saw when I \n went back down \n the pillar.	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00410k_005	I can't imagine \n how hard it must \n have been for him \n to protect the others.	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00410k_010	Will the Ark really \n take us home?	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00410k_020	The children believe \n in you.	[0, 28, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00410k_030	You'd better not be \n giving them false \n hope...	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00410k_040	If this is a lie...	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00410k_045	Even if this isn't \n real, I can't bear \n to let Zaza down.	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00410k_050	I'll get everyone home, \n trust me.	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00410k_060	I promised a little girl \n named Sachya I would.	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00410k_070	Sachya!? \n Is she okay? \n Where is she!?	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00410k_080	She's waiting for you. \n Now, help me get \n everyone on the Ark.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00500m_010	My new friend gave me the power to control gravity.	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00500m_020	And all I could think of was how I could \n save the children I had left behind.	[0, 77, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00500m_030	I worked with the other Shifter to bring the children home.	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00500m_040	My promise to bring them home was \n left half unfulfilled.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_00500m_050	I'll do whatever it takes to complete that promise. \n To save the children. And Zaza.	[0, 83, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_01000	The man with the hat left us all alone...	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_01001	He was the only adult on the bus.	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm02_01002	The huts we found down below were left behind by someone.	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
