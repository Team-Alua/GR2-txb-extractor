dm04_00100	What is this place?	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00101	First, I need to summon the element of Light.	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00110k_010	Glad to see you arrived \n safe and sound. Welcome \n to the plane where Light \n and Darkness reside.	[0, 93, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00110k_020	What's going on? \n What are you doing here?	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00110k_025	I'm a Creator, and a \n guardian of the gateway \n between worlds.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00110k_030	What we need to \n set everything straight \n again is in here.	[0, 57, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00110k_040	Now listen carefully, \n because this won't \n be easy.	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00110k_050	You'll need to wake the \n Light and Darkness and \n force them to manifest \n in physical form.	[0, 87, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00110k_060	Start with calling \n forth the element \n of Light.	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00110k_070	To do so, \n protect the \n light Nevi...	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00110k_080	And defeat the \n dark Nevi.	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00110k_083	When you do, \n you'll convert \n the areas they \n hold to the light.	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00110k_086	Once you've converted \n everything, the element \n of Light should manifest \n in physical form.	[0, 88, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00110k_090	So... \n Take down all \n of the dark Nevi?	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00110k_100	Well, if you want \n to make things \n simple. Yes.	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00110k_105	You could've just \n told me that.	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00110k_110	It won't be easy.	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00110k_120	But you're the \n only one who \n can do it.	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00110k_130	I'm not sure why, but \n you seem to be at the \n center of everything \n going wrong.	[0, 77, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00205k_010	Hahaha!	[0, 7, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00205k_020	It has been so long \n since I took this form, \n I barely remember \n what it's like.	[0, 77, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00205k_030	Who are you to \n summon the \n element of Light?	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00205k_033	And how could a human \n enter this plane?	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00205k_035	Am I to assume those \n so-called Creators are \n using you to do their \n dirty work?	[0, 77, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00205k_038	I'm here for my own \n reasons.	[0, 28, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00205k_039	I need to get you \n back in the Ark to \n power it up and \n fix things.	[0, 64, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00205k_040	Hah! \n You think you can \n control me?	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00205k_050	Then prove yourself!	[0, 20, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00205k_060	This should be fun.	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00208k_010	What's happening \n to him?	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00208k_020	Hahaha! \n The power burns \n through me.	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00208k_030	Nothing can \n stand up to the \n Light!	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00210k_003	Cyanea, you're \n here too?	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00210k_006	Deep within the \n Creator Cyanea sleeps \n a powerful force.	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00210k_010	Where there is light, \n there is darkness.	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00210k_020	Protect the dark \n Nevi...	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00210k_030	And defeat the \n light Nevi.	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00210k_040	Dark good, light bad. \n Got it - just do the \n opposite of what I \n did before.	[0, 73, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00310k_010	*Sigh*	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00310k_020	I thought I sensed \n the stench of one \n of your kind...	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00310k_030	Smell, sight, taste, \n touch - I hate having \n to take this form.	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00310k_035	You would dare \n call forth Tenebria, \n the element of \n Darkness?	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00310k_040	I'll give you one \n chance. Leave now, \n and I'll let you live.	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00310k_050	I'm not going anywhere, \n I'm here to claim your \n power!	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00310k_060	Then it's time to show \n you what happens to \n insolent fools who \n stumble into the dark.	[0, 84, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00318k_010	Ah, the Darkness \n flows through me...	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00318k_020	The element of \n Light likes to \n take the direct \n approach.	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00318k_030	But it's much \n harder to fight \n what you can't \n see.	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00318k_033	You reek of the \n emotions you hold.	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00318k_036	Love, nobility, pah - \n such worthless concepts.	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00318k_040	We'll see how \n worthless they \n are when I take \n you out!	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00410k_010	I wish there was \n time to celebrate \n your victory...	[0, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00410k_020	But you're going to \n need to get out of here. \n Quick.	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00410k_030	Without the elements of \n Light and Darkness, the \n threads binding this \n world are unravelling.	[0, 91, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00410k_040	We'll try to hold this \n place together as long \n as we can, but it's \n collapsing.	[0, 77, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00410k_050	I get the picture. It's \n time to go.	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00410k_060	And go fast.	[0, 12, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_00410k_070	The exit is just ahead.	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

dm04_01002	No!	[0, 3, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_01003	It's working.	[0, 13, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_01004	I think we're going to pull this off.	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_01005	We're doing good.	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_01006	Just one more to go.	[0, 20, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_01007	That's the last one!	[0, 20, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_01008	They stole one of the areas!	[0, 28, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_01009	I lost an area, but I should be fine.	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_01010	Lost an area, but I'm still okay.	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_01011	They took an area from me, but I should be safe.	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_01012	They grabbed an area.	[0, 21, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_01013	Guess the light Nevi are going to hang back on guard duty.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_01014	I can't take the area if there are any dark Nevi around.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_01015	I just have to take down the dark Nevi to claim their area.	[0, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm04_01016	I better move fast before the light Nevi get taken down.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
