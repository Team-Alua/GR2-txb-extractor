sm27_00100k_060	I mean, come on, look at \n how tall those buildings \n are! I'm afraid of \n heights.	[0, 77, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_00100k_070	Hmm, sounds like maybe \n you should change jobs \n again.	[0, 52, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_00100k_080	How about I help you \n out? I can shift \n gravity, so I'm fine \n with heights.	[0, 72, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_00100k_090	That would be perfect, \n thank you!	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

sm27_00105	Place the Beacon	[0, 16, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_00106	Surveyor: \n Next is the base of the old stormshield tower.	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [10, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

sm27_00300k_010	The beacon's not \n working...	[0, 27, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_00300k_020	Strange... They're \n supposed to be \n automatic.	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_00300k_030	Hold on... I think I \n might know the problem.	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_00300k_040	It could be because it's \n off balance, or gravity \n wave interference.	[0, 67, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_00300k_050	Uhh, I don't get it.	[0, 20, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_00400k_010	What are you doing!?	[0, 20, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

sm27_00500k_010	So high... Too high... \n Oh, so very high...	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_00500k_020	With a fear of heights, \n how can you stand living \n in Hekseville?	[0, 63, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_00500k_030	It's not easy...	[0, 16, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_00500k_040	But strange as it \n sounds, I like it here.	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_00500k_050	I wanted to become a \n surveyor in the first \n place to help this city.	[0, 67, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_00500k_060	I like that attitude!	[0, 21, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_00500k_070	So, what next?	[0, 14, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_00500k_080	This is the last beacon. \n It goes on the top of \n that tower.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_00500k_090	Hm?	[0, 3, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_00500k_100	C-Could you, uh, do this \n one alone?	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

sm27_01002	Surveyor: \n Ah! I think I passed out there for a second.	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [10, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_01003	Surveyor: \n The fast-blinking beacon needs to be on the left.	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [10, 59, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_01004	Surveyor: \n You need to find a spot where you can see the beacons line up.	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [10, 72, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

sm27_01006	Surveyor: \n Don't leave me way up here!	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [10, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_01007	A place where I can line the beacons up side-by-side, huh...	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_01008	Surveyor: \n It's so...so...so...so...so...high...	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [10, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_01009	No, this isn't a good spot.	[0, 27, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_01010	How about here?	[0, 15, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_01011	This should be a good place.	[0, 28, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_01012	Take a Picture of the Beacons	[0, 29, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_01013	Surveyor: \n Just hurry up, please.	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [10, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_01014	Surveyor: \n We're too far away, you need to get closer.	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [10, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_01016	The angle's a little steep, I should go up.	[0, 43, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_01017	Surveyor: \n The beacons aren't in this picture.	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [10, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_01018	Surveyor: \n You can't take the picture from the air.	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [10, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_01019	Surveyor: \n You're too far from the beacons.	[0, 10, 'DINRoundOffcPro'], [10, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

sm27_01021	I can't see the lights from this side.	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_01022	Maybe there's some place lower down?	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_01023	This place is a little too low.	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm27_01024	I can't see the beacons from here.	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
