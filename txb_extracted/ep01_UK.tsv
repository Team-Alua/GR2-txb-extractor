ep01_00070k_210	Let the workers on the \n windmill boat know they \n need to check the fuel \n supply.	[0, 77, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00070k_220	Isn't that supposed to \n be your job?	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00070k_230	Just tell 'em! \n I'm already up to my \n neck in work.	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00070k_240	Alright, alright. \n I'm going.	[0, 28, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00080k_010	Cecie, how's it going? \n Is there anything I \n can do to help?	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00080k_020	Oh, uh no, I think I \n can handle it...	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00080k_030	It's the easiest job in \n the settlement, so I \n need to prove I can do \n it myself.	[0, 78, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00080k_040	She doesn't sound too \n sure of herself...	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

ep01_00090k_040	Better get to work, \n wouldn't want to \n get Misai fired up.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00090k_050	Hey, uh, is he always \n that high strung?	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00090k_060	He's just serious about \n his work.	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00090k_070	Sure he's a little rough \n around the edges...	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

ep01_00110k_030	Lisa told me Cecie was \n just blowin' off steam \n and to leave her be.	[0, 66, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00110k_040	Really? Sounds kinda \n cold of Lisa. It is \n her daughter...	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00110k_050	Well, technically she's \n not Lisa's daughter.	[0, 44, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00110k_060	It's complicated.	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00110k_070	Complicated how?	[0, 16, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00110k_080	Oh, right! Cecie's a \n drift rat like us. \n One of the storms \n dropped her here.	[0, 75, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00110k_090	Right. Lisa felt sorry \n for her and took her in. \n Treated her like a \n daughter ever since.	[0, 87, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00110k_100	I see...	[0, 8, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00110k_110	Well, we can't just \n leave her out there!	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

ep01_00115k_030	And she's not supposed \n to go the gravel pit \n alone.	[0, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00115k_040	Guess I'd better \n check Banga over.	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

ep01_00119	The mining boat was pretty big if I remember right.	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00120	I think they always parked it in the middle of the settlement.	[0, 62, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00120k_010	Lisa, do you have \n any idea where \n Cecie might be?	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00120k_020	No, but she'll be \n back. Just leave \n her be.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00120k_030	You're not worried?	[0, 19, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00120k_040	Worrying doesn't solve \n anything, and I don't \n have time for coddling.	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00120k_050	Our job is to work hard \n and repay our debts. \n That's our way of life.	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

ep01_00130k_050	Okay, well, Cecie \n sometimes goes over to \n the gravel pit.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00130k_060	That's where the gravity \n storm first dropped her.	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00130k_070	The gravel pit, got it. \n Thanks for your help!	[0, 45, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00140k_010	Hey, isn't this where me \n and Syd first landed \n here?	[0, 51, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

ep01_00140k_030	And without Dusty, I \n can't even shift \n gravity.	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00140k_040	If I had to drift here, \n why did I have to \n end up with Syd?	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00140k_050	I hope Raven's alright. \n Where could she have \n gone?	[0, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00140k_060	Hmm...	[0, 6, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00140k_070	No, I can't start \n thinking about it again.	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00140k_080	Raven and Dusty can fend \n for themselves, I'm sure \n they're fine. Wherever \n they are.	[0, 82, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep01_00140k_090	For now, I just need to \n concentrate on finding \n Cecie.	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
