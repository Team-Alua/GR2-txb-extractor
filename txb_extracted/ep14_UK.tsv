ep14_00163k_020	Foresight, I see! A \n sixth sense, so to \n speak, regarding things \n to come in the future.	[0, 85, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep14_00163k_030	Of course, the power of \n foresight would be a \n blessing and a curse...	[0, 68, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

ep14_00171k_010	I'm starting to get \n used to this guy's \n sudden \n philosophising...	[0, 63, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep14_00171k_020	Hmm, "Justice", I \n think...	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
ep14_00171k_030	Justice, I see... The \n ability to discern right \n from wrong, the moral \n from the immoral.	[0, 86, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
