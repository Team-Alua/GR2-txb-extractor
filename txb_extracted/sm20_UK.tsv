684716f9	You understand, right? \n You'd be sad if you lost \n something special.	[0, 66, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
718f18ff	I'm sorry... I just \n wanted to have it to \n play with Zoey.	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
7ad71a05	But mother doesn't \n like dogs...	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
80c2b69d	And throw the disc to \n some place you say.	[0, 41, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
83520330	Poor girl \n looks so sad...	[0, 25, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

a4c60b01	Well, that's \n not cool...	[0, 24, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

sm20_00100	First I better take Zoey over that way.	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00100k_010	Hm? What's that \n woman doing?	[0, 28, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00100k_020	Her dog looks a \n little... down? 	[0, 32, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00100k_030	Zoey, I know you miss \n your toy, but come on \n dear, life goes on.	[0, 63, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00100k_040	Hey, is something wrong \n with your dog?	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00100k_050	She lost her favourite \n toy and hasn't been the \n same since.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00100k_060	And she can tell when I \n try to get her a new \n one.	[0, 49, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00100k_070	She hasn't shown much \n of an appetite lately, \n so I fear she'll waste \n away at this rate.	[0, 86, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00100k_080	Poor little girl. This \n sounds like a pretty \n serious problem.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00100k_090	Maybe I can help find \n her old toy?	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00100k_100	If only you could...	[0, 20, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00100k_110	My servants have scoured \n Havina but haven't found \n a thing.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00100k_120	I'm good at finding \n stuff! Did you lose it \n around here?	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00100k_130	Yes, I'm sure it's \n around this island.	[0, 38, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00100k_140	It could be somewhere \n around the fountain \n plaza...	[0, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00100k_150	Maybe you can take Zoey \n with you? She might be \n able to help.	[0, 60, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00100k_160	At the very least, a \n little exercise might do \n her good.	[0, 55, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00100k_170	Okay! Come here Zoey.	[0, 21, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00101	Have a sniff around, Zoey!	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

sm20_00109	Ah, it's just another dog.	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00110	Nope, no disc.	[0, 14, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00111	Zoey just wanted to see the fountain, I guess.	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00112	No disc there.	[0, 14, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00113	Don't see anything here...	[0, 26, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

sm20_00200k_010	This is where that woman \n said they started their \n walk...	[0, 56, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00200k_020	If Zoey lost her toy \n during the walk, it \n might be worth \n retracing their steps.	[0, 78, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00200k_030	But if her owner \n couldn't find it, it's \n probably not lying \n somewhere easy to find.	[0, 82, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00200k_040	I know! I could rely on \n Zoey's sense of smell!	[0, 46, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00300k_010	Hm? Hey, what's with \n this dog?	[0, 30, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00300k_020	Did you happen to run \n across a dog toy?	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00300k_030	A dog toy? I think not.	[0, 23, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00300k_040	Hmm, wonder what got \n into her then...	[0, 37, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00300k_050	Maybe she caught a \n whiff of the grade A \n meat skewers I picked \n up in the market.	[0, 79, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00300k_060	Yeah, guess she \n must be hungry.	[0, 31, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

sm20_00330k_030	A dog toy? No, sorry.	[0, 21, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00330k_040	Hmm, why was Zoey so \n excited then?	[0, 34, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00330k_050	Perhaps my perfume set \n her off. It uses only \n the finest fresh fruit \n extracts.	[0, 77, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00330k_060	There Zoey goes letting \n her appetite lead the \n way again...	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00400k_010	Aah! Scary doggy!	[0, 17, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

sm20_00500k_020	She ran over to the \n island with the theatre, \n so I'll bet she's still \n there.	[0, 75, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00500k_030	Maybe Zoey's sniffer can \n help me find her!	[0, 42, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00530k_010	Heya, Zoey, long time no \n see, girl!	[0, 35, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

sm20_00530k_040	You know, she comes from \n a very noble pedigree.	[0, 47, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00530k_050	Heck, she costs more \n than an airboat, so you \n have to take good care \n of her.	[0, 75, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
sm20_00530k_060	I-I will!	[0, 9, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
