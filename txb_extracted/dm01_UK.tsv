dm01_00330k_010	Raven! Did you just \n get here too?	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm01_00330k_020	Yeah, and I brought \n the energy we need.	[0, 39, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm01_00330k_030	I was wondering if \n you would ever show \n up. Hold on...	[0, 53, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm01_00330k_040	Energy levels are good. \n We should be able to \n commence the experiment.	[0, 69, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm01_00330k_043	I feel it's worth \n bringing it to \n your attention...	[0, 50, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm01_00330k_045	But today's experiment \n is all thanks to my \n boss, Dr. Brahman.	[0, 61, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm01_00330k_048	When today is done, \n he'll be famous.	[0, 36, 'DINRoundOffcPro']

dm01_00330k_070	Guess we've done all \n we can do...	[0, 33, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm01_00330k_080	Let's head over to \n the plaza and join \n the crowd.	[0, 48, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm01_00330k_090	Gade and Cyanea should \n be there already.	[0, 40, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm01_00330k_100	Too bad Syd had to \n pick today of all \n days to call in sick.	[0, 58, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm01_00330k_105	Can you believe him, \n taking such an important \n day off?	[0, 54, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm01_00330k_110	Kat... Do you really \n think this will wake \n the children in the Ark?	[0, 66, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
dm01_00330k_120	Having second thoughts? \n You were the one \n who was all for \n the experiment.	[0, 72, 'DINRoundOffcPro']
